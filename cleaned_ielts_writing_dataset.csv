2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.",,,,,,6.5,poverty represents worldwide crisis ugliest epidemic region could infect countries debilitating ways tackle issue rich countries need help need give hand possible agree several ways aiding poor countries financial aid like providing countries need engineers workers soldiers would build infrastructure building universities hospitals roadways solid infrastructure poor countries would able monetise profits build stronger profitable economy would help long term unprivilged countries find niche major hurdle would passed would definitely pave way much brighter future however disagree financial aid solve poverty used properly efficiently determining factor financial aid would way go identifying type poor countries representative dealing countries responsible leader said implementing strategy distinguish responsible leaders others would tailor type aid rich countries could use example clear report constant observation would applied track progress type aid monetized summary types aid varies country another tailoring type aid paramount importance solve problem huge toll poor countries

2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.
Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.
But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.
Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.

2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.
In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events.

2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.

Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.

Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","There is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university, there are only a few students who want to study science, leading to numerous negative effects on community. With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects.
It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead.
It is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly.
In conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society.",,,,,,8.5,currently material issue majority students eager learn business art university students want study science leading numerous negative effects community respect matter also wide variety factors influence decision students study science subjects undeniable many reasons undergraduates avoid studying science classic example science extremely difficult understand order fully comprehend particular scientific phenomenon students learn complex theories cause phenomena therefore tend choose subjects easier understand another common reason small amount salary working scientific fields student choose subjects study university tend enroll area could make lot money knowledge since science career offer high remuneration student possibly prefer study subjects business offers higher salary instead true many negative consequences society less undergraduates studying science one clear impact decreasing innovation scientific comprehension mandatory requirement creating innovation hence people understand science inevitably hold creation modern innovation furthermore current environmental crisis increase global temperature would perhaps reach point return since crisis relates environment one scientific aspects small number attention students would lead less social pressure address crisis properly conclusion fact science complicated people scientific knowledge make less money expertise areas resulting less popularity learning science university students moreover rise problem trend possibly suspends creation new innovation deteriorate current environmental issues two crucial matters society

Overall, it can clearly be seen that in 1958, adult workers divided their time roughly equally between work, sleep, and other activities. However, over the next five decades, there was a remarkable increase in working hours, a significant decrease in sleep time, and the total time allocated to other activities remained nearly unchanged.
It is surprising that adult workers spent almost the same amount of time sleeping (32%) as they did working (33%) in 1958. However, by 2008, they slept 7% less (25%) and worked 9% more (42%), which represents a remarkable increase in working hours. As a result, the time they spent at home for relaxation increased from 8% to 13%. In contrast, the time spent going out with friends and family declined dramatically by one-third, from 19% to 6%.

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.",,,,,,8.5,recent years many countries reported decrease number students choosing science subjects universities concerning trend profound impact society essay discuss reasons behind problem implications first reason fewer students selecting science subjects likely courses difficult comprehend general science courses mathematics physics involve complex theories formulas concepts require great deal hard work understand furthermore often taught theoretical manner fail show students knowledge used real life words may seem impractical learn science courses lastly may hard acquire practical job theoretical subjects future result students may give studying science find scientific studies unappealing impractical promising future careers consequently lack students studying science subjects significant impact society first foremost may enough qualified scientists teachers teach theoretical foundation technology medicine engineering could lead slow progress areas society may suffer result moreover decline number science students could lead shortage scientists research development industry would negative impact nation economy sum decreasing number students selecting science courses universities worrying phenomenon main reasons difficulty science courses lack job opportunities science studies could negative impact society may enough qualified scientists pursue research could impede progress fields technology medicine

What are the effects on society?","In this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities. There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.
The main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.
Eventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for Science Subjects in coming future. Otherwise, it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country.",,,,,,6.5,essay talk many countries students prefer choose science subject universities plenty reasons problem effect society essay suggest many reasons problem main reason problem lack trained math science teachers students get proper foundation motivation school life persue science develop science math phobia due prefer choose stream science pursue higher education eventually effect society many ways students stopped taking science majors shortage doctors people suffer many health problems secondly students take science major placement science teachers future generation according government take firm steps stop happening must training programs keep teachers date enhance enable teachers make science subjects enjoyable students instance teachers may incorporate technology learning process conclude belive government teachers take responsibility create environment learn subjects fun way eventually increase number students enrolling science subjects coming future otherwise may negative impact society good sign country

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country.

This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.
First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.
In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.
In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.",,,,,,8.0,days firmly believed efficient method teach children schools work together team sports essay disagrees statement since young students might enjoy playing sports team sports raise competitiveness amongst children hence negative impact friendly relationships first although vital children play sports keep fit everyone keen football rugby volleyball instead young students prefer spending leisure time activities joining chorus group teathre lessons activities encourage cooperation make children get along well hand forcing children play something feel comfortable make withdraw team game would make feel excluded addition teams sports always promote cooperation among players cases inequities particularly ambitious behaviours lead violent competitiveness instead generally thought sport extremely selective environment fact need exercise daily order keep fit obese children took part team sports well could feel isolated perfect body perform well conclusion although team sports great method teach children get along various activities encourage cooperation among children well therefore considerably significant school embrace diversity make children play really like instead forcing something feel belong

A very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones.
Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.

Overall, it can be clearly seen that rainwater undergoes five sequential steps to become domestic tap water, ready to be used in the house.
Firstly, roof drainage is installed for the collection of rainwater. When it rains, the water moves along the roof drainage, and pipes lead into the water filter. Next, the water filter removes basic pollutants, such as leaves and sediments, and begins the first step of water purification. After that, the water flows into a large square water storage tank and then inflows to the next tank for treatment. When enough rainwater enters the treatment tank, chemical substances are injected through a small device on top of the tank to sterilize and ensure the safety of water quality.

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.

Overall, converting water from nature into those for human daily use is a cyclical process that consists of collecting, filtering, storing, chemical treating and making the new product for reuse.
After falling from the rooftop, the water is collected by the gutter, following the direction in the drain underground. Once there, the water has to undergo the filter, which mechanically removes its impurities. This is the initial cleaning step for rainwater.
The water is then poured into a storage tank, waiting for the next cleaning experience. In this stage, it is transported to the water treatment. Chemicals are essential for this process as they will deeply remove the residue that cannot be washed by the water filter and make water fit for consumption.

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.
Initially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.
Another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.
Finally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.
It is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team’s goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.
In spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others’ point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation.",,,,,,8.0,currently contentious argument effective method young people learn cooperation team sports rather alternatives despite fact sports team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills children personally believe also vital ways upskill aspect true team sports could possibly lead collaboration children classic example jointly cooperate team members order achieve team goal reaching goal team sports requires member responsibility also help members maximize performance team addition supporters team sports may argue children also learn communicate members one key factors cooperation result young people better communication skills tend willing collaborate people situation spite aforementioned positive effects juveniles respect cooperation juveniles could also encouraged cooperate working group another alternative way common example think perspectives essential skill collaboration juveniles work people would inevitably encounter wide variety ideas might disagree therefore understand ideas others point view order reach consensus furthermore another key point cooperation adolescents learn delegation tasks group complete might requires various knowledge hence adolescents delegate task group member based expertise conclusion undeniable team sport positively result collaboration children since would get exposed situations requiring help communicate team members nevertheless totally disagree notion team sport best way teach children collaborate since assignment group could also teach motivate cooperate people terms thinking points view work delegation

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers.
One of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too.
Another point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career.
In conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers.

Do you agree or disagree?","Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.
Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.
Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.
In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated.

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
Due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
On the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
In my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
In conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees.",,,,,,9.0,today era students look forward enrolling professional courses universities however believe authorities encourage teenagers take vocational courses huge shortage professionals like electricians plumbers opinion scarcity workers government make special arrangements prospective learners certain factors also considered due insufficient work possibilities completing vocational courses extremely low wages scholars forced take loans high interest banks attend university programmes average adult pay usd yearly typical professional course university children unable accumulate sufficient funds time forces borrow amount banks job market plumbing electrical work highly unregulated leads exploitation workers established brands distressing people regulations established markets decrease risk factor workers hand due continuing increase population demand doctors engineers professors also rising recent years governments world reported widening gap number professionals available per 1000 people example india 1 doctor available per 50 people urban areas number even concerning rural areas figure patients climbs even opinion authorities universities work together towards introducing scholarships benefits learners professional courses also peoples vocational courses furthermore better wages plumbers electricians could also established attract students conclusion favourable policies implemented qualified workers attract potential learners government well lower tution fees university attendees

Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion","The increasing prevalence of furious sports has been a great concern. Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.
On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.
On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.
Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.

Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life.

Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people.

First of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time
Another reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.
Addition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.

From my point of view, I completely disagree this opinion.
Firstly, there still has a gap between rich and poor people in the reach country. As the economic situation of a country is getting better and better, it is true that most of the people would like to believe that all the residents will live a happy ever life. But still, there must be some people struggle to manage their life. Take China as an example, the GDP of China saw a dramatic increase in the recent years, people in the mega cities or the first level cities like Beijing and Shanghai do not worry about their food anymore, and can enjoy their high quality life. However, there still has some poor citizens who live in the small city and trying their best to feed their children. These poor people may not earn enough salaries or lost their job, thus, any addiction increase in economic wealth may be an opportunity for them, which can makes them feel satisfied enough.
Secondly, the growth in economic will make residents richer than before. People are living in the material world, no one will refuse the economic wealth to make their life better. A rich country means most of the residents in this country is middle or above middle class, an increase in the economic wealth means they can get a better house, send their children to a better school, spend more time on leisure activity instead of working, for all these benefits that the economic growth bring to them, they would fell satisfied.

I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society.
To begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift.
Additionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past.

2,Write about the following topic.An increasing number of people are choosing to have cosmetic surgery in order to improve their appearance. Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.
It is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
Contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections.",,,,,,8.0,currently contentious argument regarding purpose cosmetic surgery since people prefer use method improve appearance considering factors support decision choose improvement method various reasons discuss essay terms consequences personally believe positive development fact people wide variety rationales cosmetic surgery obvious example people design new appearance way wish look like doctor could perform modern medical techniques modifying bone patients nose change real face natural face improvement another common reason increase people plastic surgery tend believe appearance accepted people helping feel confident contemplating effects people plastic surgery many vital advantages common criticism favour rise productivity workplace people feel confident result cosmetic surgery tend courageous communicate people departments leading increasing workflow two teams another classic example building networking people positively improve appearance tend attract people attention result people might want know conclusion undeniable cosmetic surgery could address people eagerness better appearance confident opinion results positive consequence society would willingness contact people draw people attention could grow connections

2,Write about the following topic.An increasing number of people are choosing to have cosmetic surgery in order to improve their appearance. Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People have always desired to improve their external features. However, while the time went by, methods of changing appearance for the better have significantly changed. Today, more and more people decide to improve the way they look via cosmetic surgery. In the following essay I'm going to speculate on the topic and explain some possible reasons of this trend.
Obviously, there are plenty of reasons of this tendancy. To start with, operation is an easy way of improving your appearance. People are attracted by this method because they don't need to go to the gym or control their diet anymore. The only thing they need is to call a special doctor and pay money. In addition, it's obvious that every trend is caused by the changes of standarts in society. Nowadays, the number of people who are sure that unnatural beauty is attractive is growing every day. Affected by the opinion of their friends or family members more and more women decide to use surgery in order to change face or other part of the body.
Personally, I strongly believe that this bandwagon both worsens the way people look harms health as well. I'm convinced that nothing can surpass natural beauty; meanwhile, every medical operation goes against people's organism and spills what was created by the universe. For example, some famous artists who have used cosmetic surgery in order to stay young are now looking like dolls. What's more, sometimes chemicals which are used during such operations can cause awful consequences for not only people's appearance, but for their health as well. I can still remember a story of one boy who wanted to swell his muscles in a shorter way by using some medecine but, as a result, he appeard in a hospital with serious blood illness due to inappropriate choice and careless usage.
Taking everything into account, it's my firm conviction that even though cosmetic surgery seems to be a proper way of improving appearance, it is very overrated. On the contrary, such operations do not only worsen the way people look , but can be extremely dangeraus for their organism as well, while natural beauty is here to stay forever.",,,,,,7.5,people always desired improve external features however time went methods changing appearance better significantly changed today people decide improve way look via cosmetic surgery following essay going speculate topic explain possible reasons trend obviously plenty reasons tendancy start operation easy way improving appearance people attracted method need go gym control diet anymore thing need call special doctor pay money addition obvious every trend caused changes standarts society nowadays number people sure unnatural beauty attractive growing every day affected opinion friends family members women decide use surgery order change face part body personally strongly believe bandwagon worsens way people look harms health well convinced nothing surpass natural beauty meanwhile every medical operation goes people organism spills created universe example famous artists used cosmetic surgery order stay young looking like dolls sometimes chemicals used operations cause awful consequences people appearance health well still remember story one boy wanted swell muscles shorter way using medecine result appeard hospital serious blood illness due inappropriate choice careless usage taking everything account firm conviction even though cosmetic surgery seems proper way improving appearance overrated contrary operations worsen way people look extremely dangeraus organism well natural beauty stay forever

What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.
In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.
The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.
There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.

For example, in 2000 the country made 11,155,000 litres, and in 2010 11,466,000. Australia followed the trend for the first 10 years.

2,Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.
One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.
On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.
In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.
In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.",,,,,,7.0,whether parents fully intervene children organization leisure time let decide remains big discussion essay contrast two opinions explain think good balance needed one reasons supporting first view idea undeveloped children ability organize although might seem mature age others might struggle understanding importance routine besides playing video games instance many parents orientate children helping organize hobbies teaching important skill time managment hand people encourage children decide stimulates creativity personal growth view therefore opens new world little ones decide whatever like multiple options example children situation quite often supported want play sports participate painting class opinion parents envolved much aspects children lives also might encourage little ones personal opinions decision hobbies leisure actitivities may good way build trust communication parents children moreover children learn responsability guided parents conclusion parents help children scheduling free time others intervene less leaving create routine freely believe parents always involved children lives decisions allowing children participation brings multiple benefits relationship

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"What children like to do in free time ? All children have diffrent ideas and preferences. So that many parenets think what should they provide and organize for their kids or not.
Children have free mind. Sometimes that make out of control their behaviours. In this modern world, we have so manyv tools to connect to out side of their world, for example internet, social network. If parents are not organised to kids's freet time, children have so many chance to take those tools. Not all internet stuffs are bad, but also there are lots of appropriate contents for kids around. Kids should be protected and orverviewed by parents or caregivers whatever they are doing. Moreover, if they are not controlled their free time by parents, kids never have limit of spending time for something they are into it. Time management is important for kids, free time shouldn't be until late night.
On the other hand, what will be happned if parents don't organised their free time.
Kids are using their imagination or ideas in their free time to play. There is no organising stuff from parents, so that they might try to find what they need and want to do. Therefore, they develop their indepndence and social skills.
In my opinion, I think kids should be organised their free time by parents. Compared with both side of effect, I personally choose kids's safety rather than developping independence.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Apart from education, leisure is an essential part that helps children to discover their interests and develop both physical and mental abilities. While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.
To begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.
Despite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.
All in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests. However, these decisions must be reviewed and approved by the parents to ensure the budget added and security of the children themselves.",,,,,,7.5,apart education leisure essential part helps children discover interests develop physical mental abilities many agree parents responsible managing children free time others argue kids entitled make decisions grown personally believe kids allowed select activities based preferences within scope provided parents per following reasons begin one likes forced long days either tiresome work study everyone wants enjoy time afterwards also applies students many cultures put school classes spend time tutoring order catch academic standards although endure intense lifestyle time schedules usually cause kids overworked stressed therefore important spare times children manage activities nevertheless unlike adults financially independent kids subjected many limitations despite able participate many activities underages must legally supervised several reasons one abilitiy parents play important part disapproving activities inappropriate kids example accompanied consulted children end meeting strangers playing dangerous extreme sports furthermore time underages usually rely parents earnings lead back approving recreational budgets necessary allow kids autonomy free time allows develop sense responsibility along discovering interests however decisions must reviewed approved parents ensure budget added security children

Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...

This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.
To start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.
However, there are also potential drawbacks to this journey. First and foremost, they can encounter some dangerous situations, such as being scammed, robbed, and even physically harmed. Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed.

2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.

Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.
Moreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.
However, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities.

It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
On the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. In order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. Nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. Besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.
On the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.

Overall, it can be clearly seen that while the popularity of food and drink, and entertainment increased as people got older, the demand for restaurant and hotel changed in the opposite direction.
Turning to the first main feature, people who were under 30 years old were the majority group that spent on restaurant and hotel, amounting to just below 15% of the total spending, whereas older people in the 61-75 age group spent on this category the least, accounting for approximately 2%. In addition, there was a little more than 10% of the total spending which was contributed by people who were in the 31-45 and 46-60 age group equally.
Turning to another main feature, in terms of food and drink, there was only just above 5% of the total spending, paid by people who were under 30 years old. Nevertheless, the expenditure ratio rose as the number of age was higher. The largest proportion of spending on food and beverage was about 23%, contributed by people who were 76 years old or over.

2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.",,,,,,7.5,decades belief adults support adolescents work company travel another country least one year going university despite fact many positive aspects experiences terms working travelling studying university careful consideration also negative points true working travelling starting university program positively affects juveniles development classic example effective way truly understand academic preferences juveniles work experiences internship company tend learn wide variety work functions helping know academic discipline want learn university another benefit taking long journey another place studying university opportunity get exposed new culture adolescents epic expedition parts world tend meet new people different nationality belief leading valuable life experiences receive professor university spite aforementioned advantages working travelling starting university courses also drawbacks common example graduating college late compared juveniles immediately start university program finish high school exemplified thai culture believes young people graduate university later peer would successful career path addition opponents notion might argue working finishing university well worth since works require strong academic foundation order juveniles deliver results fewer mistakes juveniles study university instead conclusion undeniable work experiences taking journey starting university life many benefits young people respect knowing academic fields want study learning new cultures outside classroom nevertheless could also drawbacks terms delay university graduation ineffective performance working

2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.
It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.
In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English.",,,,,,8.5,currently contentious argument using english international language always benefits drawbacks despite use english spreading globally positive effects communication various aspects personally believe disadvantages spread english eventually significant true countries use english common language advantages implementation outweigh negative consequences classic example people country could communicate easier way language barrier preventing people deliver messages others furthermore using english globally tend less misunderstanding communicating exemplified natives live country speak language people understand say completely therefore terms global perspective everyone conversations english misleading communication tend less occurred spite aforementioned positive consequences growing use english also potential drawbacks common example missing languages languages used small groups people tend fade away due fact majority people would pay attention english without conserving languages addition nations apply english international language tend small global economic growth countries international markets understand english hence countries whose people unable apply english could inevitably less opportunities make commercial deals countries ability speak english conclusion undeniable spread english positively affects way people different countries communicate significantly decreases inaccurate information conversations nevertheless development lead lost languages declining economy countries totally disagree notion advantages increasing popularity english continue outweigh disadvantages personally think aforementioned negative impacts two crucial aspects using english

In terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before .

Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.
Moreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.

2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.

Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide.

As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.
I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.
I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it.

Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?
First of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.
Food safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.
Nevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects.

One of the solution being brought into spotlight is consuming insects. While some people believe that this can be a proper path to end the world's hunger, others argue that it will further lead new problems.
To begin with, there are various aspects of advantages in using bugs as protein substitutes. Bugs are not only available in all continents but the majority of them have short life cycles. If farms shift to grow insects rather than the currently available lifestock, less costs and investments will be needed as they only need weeks to mature while other lifestocks require months or even years. Then, what prevent the humanity to covert to insectivore?
As well as tremendous benefits, the idea of consuming athropods can raise numbers of concerns. Introduction of new insect species and increase of their populations can extremely affect native ecosystem. To elaborate this, alien species introduced from one area to another can be dangerously invasive and can ultimately result in extinction of native species. One example is gold fish which were released into lakes can multiply their populations in short period and over the years, they doubled in size and eradicated their counterparts in original food chain. Therefore, arthropods which are much smaller and aglier can effortlessly escape farms and survive in extreme environment will cause disasters to the nature and crops in the farming areas.

As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand.

Chicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature. Although small, they are a significant part of the ecosystem. Making insects a food option would decrease their numbers which could create crucial changes that we are not prepared for.

Some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.
however, there is some cultivating support that comes from insects which is a positive impact on the land or cultivating areas. Such as, it helps plants to grow fast and healthier. Many people use insects in their cultivating land as organic manure. it reduces dying trees and plants and provides enough energy and nutrition to plants to grow faster, healthier, and keep fresh. All over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. By using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.

The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.
The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons.

However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.
As the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or elders’ clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.
Another reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.
Last but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.
In conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management.",,,,,,6.5,world experiencing rapidly aging population issue providing proper care elderly concerning society however inclined believe increase elderly people control many challenges likely taken place effective ways manage civil segment cooperation government private sectors elderly population expanding demand nursing homes elders clubs increase meet demand private sectors investing type institutions services foresee lucrative profit businesses probably generate near future apparently young people occupied daily job makes impossible take care parents grandparents therefore sending elderly nursing homes hiring personal care service reasonable options consider another reason validate opinion balance labor force developed countries experiencing aging population scenario opposite developing countries whose birth rate considerably high result many developed countries germany encouraged welcoming entry young laborers nursing industry one friend settling germany following moving country 5 years ago become nursing staff elderly clubs last least government interference elderly care highly recommended suggested government allocate budget establish elderly homes mitigate financial burden acquire service moreover regulations pension plan properly adjusted taken seriously employers people assured financially retire conclusion believe elderly problem likely handled well joint effort private public sectors creating healthcare system human resource management

Start with the Cell Body, otherwise known as the soma, it has shape of small ball in its center with tree-roots like lines surrounding it. These lines are called the Dendrites, and theu are responsible for the communication between the neurons. The Dendrites send and recive messages between neurons when physically contacting with each other.
The second part that forms the neuron, is called the Action potential. This section of the neuron consist of the Axon and the Myelin sheath. First of all, the Axon, which is formed as long line extending from the Dendrites, is considred the communication bridge between the cell body and other neurons, muscles, or glands. The second part og the Action potential, is the Myelin sheath cylinders, which are connected with each other as a chain.

This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.
First of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.
Nevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.
To summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser.

Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.
Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.

I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.
In regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.
By contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.
In conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","My custom topic: It is important for people to take risks, in both their professional lives and personal lives.
Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?
I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.
Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.
Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.
Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different.

The economic progress is an important goal for governments, because firstly, a healthy economy results in job creations, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services.

first of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.
Desipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities.

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.
To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.
Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.

However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.
The main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.
Another reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health.

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people’s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals’ health conditions.
Undoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants’ health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.
However, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals’ mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.
Furthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens’ health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens’ health conditions can be diminished physically.

On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities.

In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.
The utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.
Another benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.
The third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.
In a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose.

Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress.

A growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills.

In 1998, once you entered the museum you would first encounter the entrance/ exit and the thickets shop. On the left, there was a temporary exhibition room and on the right, there was a shop, the bathroom and a bags and coat hanger.
At that time the museum had three permanent exhibition rooms: one on the left, next to the temporary exhibition room, and two on the right, adjacent to the shop and WC.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.
First of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.
In fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.
Furthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.
One of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.
Besides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.
Lastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.
To illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.
In conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software.

I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence. Many learners, on the other hand trying to translating every text while they are reading an article, it may be useful to conquer the hardships initially, but in the long run they may forget all the contents since they are not memorize the meanings of a word and just let it go after the reading.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Learning a language seems to be an advantage even though there are plenty of translation softwares can be accessed to in this era. I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence. Many learners, on the other hand trying to translating every text while they are reading an article, it may be useful to conquer the hardships initially, but in the long run they may forget all the contents since they are not memorize the meanings of a word and just let it go after the reading. The result is that they are underperforming because lack of training and unable to interprete the definition of words.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",,,,,,7.5,translation softwares convenience see popping around us days seen used daily life around even recently example recently airport travel east coast west coast us passenger line luggage drop phone talking attendants using phone paying closer attention realized using translation software understand said respond back took effort sides end worked example translation software making peoples lives easier regular basis witnessing got thinking would happened absence service available literally tips fingers absence easy access technology today however come one thing human capacity learn communicate one language coming multicultural background none neighbors spoke language inevitable would exposed multiple languages since childhood reality metropolitan cities around world three years old could communicate degree mother tongue native language father ensured also learned another one national languages prevalent region time years old could conveniently speak two languages meanwhile school exposed english alphabet addition two languages made easy learn understand english categorically say knowing three languages made life infinitely easier since moved around lot due father work arrangements later college days met best friend eighteen years exposed native language mother tongue since picked passing knowledge language well movies plays around us young used multiple languages result passing knowledge six languages today knowledge makes communicating breeze areas country keeps brain active conclusion believe translation softwares definitely make life easier us different occasions bilingual trilingual polyglot serves make life interesting easy time truly understanding speaking language brings light many nuanced facets entire culture surrounding language translated translation software proven learning multiple languages helps keep human brain adaptable flexible marks young active mind personal experiences believe translation softwares serve quick solution language barrier people general learning language brings level richness ones experience life whole translations softwares therefore considered replacement learning language aide learning new skill

For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.
However, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation. Encouraging new challenges in life could give us to develop and explore new skills or new ways of thought.

It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.

Learn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.
On the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.

Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.

This makes possible the exit of the water in excess. Indeed, internal runoff could cause an incontrolled increase of the water level. Thus, the floodgate is very important to mantain stable the level of water. Regardless of the presence of the stopbank, buildings should not touch the ground. They should be elevated in order to allow a higher level of the water without causing damages to the houses.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, a topic often discussed is the education and its relation with the difference in people's ability and possibilities. According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.
People that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.
The other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.
To conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability. But if you want to educate people as humankind you should not divide the class.",,,,,,7.0,nowadays topic often discussed education relation difference people ability possibilities according better separate students based academic skills others believe valid education transmitted without discriminating people based ability people support separation students believe omogeneous group learn better faster indeed someone less skills compared others component group teachers two possibilities first lower level lessons order allow catch second leave behind student wiht low ability solutions optimals thus put together students similar capabilities make process learing efficent groups vision educate students together encourage low skills students engage theirselves catch brilliant one moreover split group students less capabilities develop problems think best group another good point educate students together people higher ability help classmates however level class probably lower conclude think best solution depends purpose educator age students indeed differet education children teenagers example want create future class engineers divide students based academic ability want educate people humankind divide class

Overall, there are two ways to do this. The first one is using a stopbank. The other one is raising the house under the 100 year flood level. Also we can use a mix of them.
According to the picture, the stopbank is a useful way to prevent flooding by building a little dump between the house and the river. Before constructing it we should know the level of the flood around the previous 100 years and our dump should be higher. Moreover, the stopbank will make an internal pond which will be created by internal runoff, accordingly we should give water to return back to the river via floodgate.
Additionally, it is shown that we could use piles to raise a building above water. In doing this we should carry about 300 mm freeboard between the house flood and the water level.",,,,,,5.0,given picture represents way houses around coastline could prevented flood overall two ways first one using stopbank one raising house 100 year flood level also use mix according picture stopbank useful way prevent flooding building little dump house river constructing know level flood around previous 100 years dump higher moreover stopbank make internal pond created internal runoff accordingly give water return back river via floodgate additionally shown could use piles raise building water carry 300 mm freeboard house flood water level

The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.
On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.
On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.
In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","I believe students should be divided according to their academic ability this is because specific students require different amounts of support according to their abilities.
Students that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.
However if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.
If students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.
However if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.

1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.
The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’
If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’",,,,,,7.5,schemes compare two different methods defence homes easily affected floods overall show flood protection without stopbank home raised higher ground level two pictures first diagram depicts stopbank acts natural barrier prevent river water flooding stopbank small mound land next river higher level prevents drain overwhelming banks nearby buildings built stilts prevent flooding rainwater well water passing floodgate beneath stopbank resulting area internal stopbank described second diagram would nothing stop river flooding case solution put homes stilts much higher one first picture height stilts measured ensure floor house three hundred meters level regardless deep water area house measure called freeboard

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.
Proponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students’ needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student’s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.
Others, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student’s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children’s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.
In conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters’ gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead.",,,,,,8.0,nowadays people hold different ideas distribute students schools individuals argue minors taught separately based academic performance whereas others state ought educated together essay discuss viewpoints although opinion better allocate students together regardless capabilities proponents idea dividing children different levels argue selection better facilitate efficient productive learning environment different students specifically schools provide specific objectives meet students needs young people distinctiveness learning preferences personalities interests therefore selecting separating youth range classes based talents intelligence schools tailor syllabus explore student maximum potential also improve quality education since excellent students learn fast way without anyone left behind contrast ordinary students still keep majority complete comprehension furthermore also minimise possible pressure academically challenged students suffer negative psychological impacts considering poor performance exams assignments others however point mixed classes attach great importance contribution healthy competition collaboration also make valid arguments despite possible imbalance student academic performance class superior peers serve desirable role models others strengths learning attitudes methods enlighten rest class improve study addition diversity class promote mutual study among children different abilities create better environment children development since way streaming students proven effective practical mode teaching highly advisable educational experts still many schools following norm educate children rather set apart many students excellent study may experience disappointment lack confidence compared students separated classrooms conclusion although teaching resources assigned precisely target youngsters gifts streaming still early unfair stage therefore believe better mix students different levels abilities dynamic harmonious class undoubtedly never discriminate unfairly students highly encouraged instead

Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.
The most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.
The other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.
Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.
On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
During the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
To sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage.",,,,,,6.5,people argue gay marriage trend might negatively affect society controversially others believe marriages natural people right choose kind marriage essay discusses gay marriage defined trend regarded people right thus legal marriage last years several arguments arose favour marriage decades people believed gay people allowed get married considered traditional image family example people would able love care child traditional family could belief behind thought related patriarchal educational concept child needs grow presence mother father thus relations considered natural people considering definition love caring someone involves indicated people feel express love care someone love feeling goes beyond gender people right love get married hence due presence patriarchal belief world countries gay marriage legal right yet world people express need democratic politically correct free biases discrimination marriage globally legalised change mindset might needed example people begin see marriage expression love rather right moral action procreate sum people marriage trend could impact society others gay marriage natural expression love thus marriage allowed regardless gender people govemrnts support legalised marriage

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Thanks to the modern society, people feel free to behave more naturally than before, without the necessity of hiding aspects of their personal life, such as the sexual orientation. For that reason, the number of omosexual women and men seems to increas and some people are worried about the impact that this could have on the society. In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.
Nowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.
Furthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.
Considering the above point, I think that people should have the right to choose from their own who to share their life with, without any legal restriction. In order to allow that, the governement should legalize the marriage between gay couples.",,,,,,6.0,thanks modern society people feel free behave naturally without necessity hiding aspects personal life sexual orientation reason number omosexual women men seems increas people worried impact could society opinion government interfere topic consequently gay marriage legally allowed nowadays omosexual couple difficult society recognise rights eterosexual couple possibility adopt children share goods human beings gay women men opportunities rights every people hence allowed legally marry live life normal one furthermore think gay couples affect wellness society way indeed even people believe possible family traditional one true kind family exist many children grow people sex affect education influence thought reason different type family recognised considering point think people right choose share life without legal restriction order allow governement legalize marriage gay couples

In today's world people are thought to treat everyone equally, to accept other people's desires and opinion and not to judge them based on that. Morals that did not exist in that past. Happiness should not be judged or illegal. When a person is happy he will want to give back and help others by, for example, volunteering and solving public issues and participating in charity organisations.
Furthermore, the acceptance of gay marriages has other great effects. For example, gay people biologially cannot have offspring. This has two main benefits . Firstly, world population is growing at an alarming rate and gay marriages help lower that rate of birth because of their biological nature. Secondly, if a gay couple decides that they want to have a child, they can addopt one. That is great because nowadays orphanages are a shellter for many kids who do not have a family.

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The scenario of two people getting married was always welcomed in society but not if those two are of the same sex. This question remains quite arguable currently. A part of the population tends to have the opinion that gay marriage could affect the community in a destructive way, while the other part sees this perspective as the development of social nature, freedoms, and basic human rights. I believe that every individual person has the own will to decide for themselves who they want to marry, overall, other people are not the ones to make a decision.
First of all, it is widely recognized that conservative and religious societies have a low tolerance for gay marriage because it can destroy their core values and outlook in life. It is generally known that such people think that the legalization of gay marriage can lead to the devaluation of heterosexual couples and their marriage, which is extremely harmful to the community. For example, there is one opinion widely spread in Utah that such legalization can devalue heterosexual marriage, which will lead to an active extramarital sex life, and therefore to a wild increase in the number of abortions. So, it is clear that gay marriage can be adverse.
On the other hand, forbidding marriages that are not heterosexual equals ignoring the basic rights and freedoms of every person. Besides, the research in Utah shows that the previously mentioned fear is completely irrational and Global Health Organization declared that being homosexual is not one of the mental problems. When couples live together and love each other but can not be bounded by official documents, it can cause a lot of legal problems. For instance, when one of them is in the hospital in critical condition, the other can not make a decision about treating or even visiting a beloved one due to the fact that they are not legally related. Such conditions could lead even to fatal consequences.

Parents and government share the responsibility to keep children well-being. This essay will discuss reasons and examples of how both sides have responsibilities toward the children.
To begin with, Politicians should have an obligation to legislate laws that stop some food companies from selling high-calorie diets in the country. Laws toward diet companies should ban them from increasing sweeteners in candies to rise profits. In the same manner, the government has a duty to build outdoor play-ground and clubs to help parents raise healthy kids. Gardens should be grown to overcome obesity. In the UAE each block in the city has its own garden and playground. Research in the Netherlands shows a huge decline in obese children after the government renewed old playgrounds.
Parents on the other hand share a tremendously important rule. Parents should encourage their children to practice sports and substitute bad habits. Pampering the kids with a sweetened diet should be stopped. Parents should read about the effect of obesity on their kids' health. For example, simple sugar rise the glucose level rapidly causing the unexpected energetic status of the kid before bedtime. Some medical cases were seen among children related to obesity like cardio-pulmonary illnesses. If the parents were aware of these consequences they would discourage the bad habits of their children.
To sum up, government do its role in keeping the kids' wellness by building institutions and providing laws on their behalf. Also, parents should educate themselves and their children, and stop unnecessary food habits.",,,,,,6.5,obesity among children risen past years parents government share responsibility keep children essay discuss reasons examples sides responsibilities toward children begin politicians obligation legislate laws stop food companies selling diets country laws toward diet companies ban increasing sweeteners candies rise profits manner government duty build outdoor clubs help parents raise healthy kids gardens grown overcome obesity uae block city garden playground research netherlands shows huge decline obese children government renewed old playgrounds parents hand share tremendously important rule parents encourage children practice sports substitute bad habits pampering kids sweetened diet stopped parents read effect obesity kids health example simple sugar rise glucose level rapidly causing unexpected energetic status kid bedtime medical cases seen among children related obesity like illnesses parents aware consequences would discourage bad habits children sum government role keeping kids wellness building institutions providing laws behalf also parents educate children stop unnecessary food habits

On the other hand, 69 percent of the rubbish is recycled in Republic of Korea, and only 9 percent is incinerated. Others are undergrounded.

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.
First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself.",,,,,,6.0,next essay talk reasons behind need people find family history believe certain young countries usa example completely logical feel need getting know roots come take account many cases sector usa population know nationality history grandparents grandparents information parents total history family quite sort spanish lived one year state washington american family surprising find proud family european roots took understand feelings needed put shoes give live example american dad even visited northern part norway close artic polar circle look distant cousin figured american dad happiest person earth showing picture cousin taking beer norway believe many reasons someone dig history deeper knowledge family firstly may get better understanding behaviours closest relatives also find reasons behind colour skin eyes summarise strongly believe positive get know roots distant relatives get better understanding youself

Another very markable difference is shape of the charts. India chart has shape of triangle, it means that there are linear dependence between ""Percent"" and age. Also, we can notice, that proportion of male and female is almost equal for Indian people. France chart has more complicated structure. The bottom of the chart has square shape, so the the amount of people is almost equal for each group below 35, then chart has shape of triangle as a India chart.

There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.
But why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.
In my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.

This is really important because without our anscestors we would not have been born or in other words - without the past there would be no future. If one respects his family and himself enough, he should learn about who they were and where they came from.
Furthermore, learning about one's family history can be very benefitial in finding your talents. For instance, if someone finds out that in the family there once was someone who was great footballer, then this is something one should try out. Geneticaly, some people are born with specific talents, predisposing them to pursuit a ceratin career path.

Therefore, some people across the world try to research their own family's history in order to appreciate their efforts, this may be out of curiosity. This essay argues that one should not put out their inquisitiveness and should try to learn more about how their family really came to be.
Inquiring about one's predecessors should be persured as learning more about your own family can never be harmful, infact, doing so will only make one more appreciative towards their family and its history. Like, if it is revealed that one's family had made many sacrifices in order to preserve their bloodline and nuture it to what it is today then it would make the current family members thankful for what they have and where they stand.
Having knowledge about one's own family tree is one of the ways to make a person humble and appreciative for what they have, it also teaches a person to work hard for their own family in the future in order to provide them with a good and healthy life. Nowadays, majority of the families have cultures and customs exclusive to their own family and by studying their ancestors, the true significance of these activities can be discorvered, taught and passed down to the future generations.

Subsequently, the dried fur is sent to a spinning machine where the fur is not only spun into some wool but also some string while the string is going to be recycled. In the following stage, the wool is made into tufts of wool and stored together to become the tuft storage.

2,"Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.
Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.
However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people believe that money is the main reason why employees want to remain in the same workplace for a long time, even there could be many other reasons why to stay. It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.
The reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
On the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.

There are a total of about 13 steps where raising sheep is an initial step and woolen products such as carpets and jackets are the final step.
To put into detail, growing up sheep is the starting process to obtain enough amount of wool. Thereafter, the fur covering the sheep is completely shaved, which is followed by cleaning and drying. Besides, dried wool is sent onto the spinning step, which creates wool. The spinning process also produces string, which is mainly reused. Tufts of wool which is made by crossing wools are delivered into tuft storage. A tuft of wool which is picked up is formed into a round shape, which is called balls of yarn.

To begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.
Some augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.
Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.
Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.
Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The use of products and goods with a lot of packaging is a highly controversial topic between people today. A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging. I personally believe that it is the individuals responsibility to cease buying products with an increased amount of packaging, since a decrease in demand from customers could prevent further production of these goods.
The people that is of the opinion that it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging, believe that these companies have a moral obligation to preserve and protect the environment. In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.
However, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.
To summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm.

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is oft remarked that in recent times, only customers have the responsibility to avoid cosuming products with various wrappings; nonetheless, I only partly consent to this statement. Hence, this fact-based essay will examine both perspectives of this phenomenon and proffer my concluding opinion.
There is a plethora of underlying rationales for why producers and marketers should control the overusing of packaging. To begin with, it appears to be undeniable that they should applied recycle materials to contain foods and drinks, which can reused to cover beverages again. Perhaps one of the most self-evident and much-discussed examples of this can be observed when beer bottles are usually collected and brought to plans in order to remake and sell a second time. And what is more, another salient point frequently made is that they should find out the best way to simplify the wrapping process to consumed fewer bags, which still perfectly protect products.
When viewed from a distinctive angle; notwithstanding, I also concede that consumers also have the function to reduce the using of packages. First and foremost, citizens can bring their own bags while shopping to avoid taking numerous nilon bags which offered by sellers. For instance, they can bring hanmade bags, paper boxes or recycle packages to buy foods comfortably.

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is oft remarked that in recent times, only customers have the responsibility to avoid cosuming products with various wrappings; nonetheless, I only partly consent to this statement. Hence, this fact-based essay will examine both perspectives of this phenomenon and proffer my concluding opinion.
There is a plethora of underlying rationales for why producers and marketers should control the overusing of packaging. To begin with, it appears to be undeniable that they should applied recycle materials to contain foods and drinks, which can reused to cover beverages again. Perhaps one of the most self-evident and much-discussed examples of this can be observed when beer bottles are usually collected and brought to plans in order to remake and sell a second time. And what is more, another salient point frequently made is that they should find out the best way to simplify the wrapping process to consumed fewer bags, which still perfectly protect products.
When viewed from a distinctive angle; notwithstanding, I also concede that consumers also have the function to reduce the using of packages. First and foremost, citizens can bring their own bags while shopping to avoid taking numerous nilon bags which offered by sellers. For instance, they can bring hanmade bags, paper boxes or recycle packages to buy foods comfortably. Apart from the above-mentioned pivotal point, it may not be untrue to assert that customers should also read about the disadvantages of garbage overload to boost their awareness about using packages suitably to protect our natural environment.

At the beginning, the figure of the percentage of city citizens all had a significant increase. For those who were borned in Australia, its number grew from about 50% in 1995 to over 60% in 2010, while for those who were borned outside Australia, there was a 20% increase.

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Opnions are divided on whether manufacturers and supermarkets should reduce the numbers of packaging of products, or consumers should not buy over-packaging goods. From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.
On the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.
On the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.
In conclusion, even though customers can help to solve this case, I believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over-packaged goods, becasue if all sellers are competiting on it, customers will have no choices.",,,,,,7.0,opnions divided whether manufacturers supermarkets reduce numbers packaging products consumers buy goods perspective although asking customers take action reasonable strongly hold service providers play important role issue one hand reason people think customers duties ia driven demand specific choose buy things good packaging goods usually packaged hence reduce demands products producers sellers naturally stop package avoid reduction busidness profits example people persuaded simply use piece paper wrap gift box instead using large number decorations hand think driven merchants control specifically order sell goods better uauslly regard packaging tool attract purchasers addition competitors find help sale products also promote competition packaging lead excessive packaging take fast food example obviously sometimes using one bag fit food gain greater advantage competition may use box wrap creates vicious cycle conclusion even though customers help solve case believe manufacturers supermarkets take main responsibility reduce goods becasue sellers competiting customers choices

Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.
To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.
On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should
not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.
Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.

Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
In addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.

First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
The mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
Another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
In conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.
The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.
Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
Cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
Recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
Finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems.",,,,,,5.0,people governments believe reducing carbon dioxide cars vehicles effective way solve environment problem although points also neccesaliry developed except car vehicles believe spending cost fuel cars emit detrimental substances play biggest effect environmental improvement cars vehicles airplanes ubiquitous around world people rely transport type must cars around world even developing countries addition recent cars released decades tend durable energy petrol resource made fossil fuel means cars emit carbon dioxide across globe highest volume carbon dioxide considered cars therefore majority fact global warming caused cars airplanes recently car industry become aware issue starting manufacturing cars never emit carbon dioxide example companies especially tesla porsche already released cars consume energy electricity instead petrol effort cause drastic reduction transmitting carbon dioxide countries planning regulate laws cars consume energy electricity finally course issues lead harmful environments around world deforestation disposal rubbish incineration agriculture example growing cows much generate methane gas also relates global warming however doubt total volume environmental problem must cars vehicles hence effective shift energy resources detrimental limited sustainable clean energy car industry must valuable first step resolve environmental problems

generally, increasing the cost of gas or fuel would decrease the amount of people utilising environment detriment vehicles. Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.
In my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.
To strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.

Listening to music after a long working day is a greate practice that will help you decrease stress. There are diferent types of music, some are belived to be more relaxing than others like classical music compare to rock and roll. Scientists have demostrated by several investigations that music helps people reduce stress, after listening to music people feel more calm and have more clear thoughts.
Some people think that music most important function is not reducing stress , instead they found it superficial and distracting. They think other activities are better at reducing stress like yoga or playing sports. Not all people feel relax by listening to music, some may find it unconfortable or unnecessary.
To summarise music most important function is that helps people reduce stress. Music as a tool for reducing stress can be used by listening to it at the end of your day or during it, this will help you overcome your weekly rutine. Classical music is recomended over several styles of music to be the more relaxing one.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In most people's life, music takes a special place. No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.
Music can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.
On the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.
In summary, based on the above-reviewed examples of how music can be helpful in stress-relief, we can see that there is two possible mechanism, a passive and an active, which can play a role in this phenomenon.",,,,,,7.0,people life music takes special place matter one favourite classical pop rock rap help people distract attention unwanted thoughts alleviate stress even reduce pain strong belief music significant psychological effect maintaining mental health vital impacts visible mood stress music induce extremely strong changes people mental states several everyday examples highlight tranquillizing effect music many people find merely instinct tend calm listening favourite tunes someone feels anxious important exam medical visit date music provide couple minutes escape stressful situations way event venue soft music also frequently utilized meditative activities yoga relaxation additionally people come across type calming tunes dental medical settings well however quite passive coping techniques hand active possible mechanisms music reduce stress dancing working upbeat music people decrease stress levels movement even efficient way let harmful energies behind effect music tends soul movement good body reducing tension muscles summary based examples music helpful see two possible mechanism passive active play role phenomenon

people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people’s quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.

It is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.
Music addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. Without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.
This makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. For example, I am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. As a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. In addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. Such as listening to the verses of the Quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.
Furthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. People who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. Nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words.
There are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.
Furthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.
I believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.
Secondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.
One evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.
In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages.

For instance, I sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if I write to him or her.

For example, during my work, I communicate via messages more than via calling. Sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that I was rude and insult them.
Finally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. This fact has a lot of cons and pros. I think that cons dominate under pros.

Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.
For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.
Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart.

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.

As it is charted out, the oil participates in around 50% of the process, starting from step 4 to step 9.
The process begins in steps 1, 2 and 3 with heating water till evaporation, so steam forms. This steam then flows through the aromatic plants gathering oil in form of vapor in step 4. Within the 5th step, the vaporized oil along with the preformed steam migrate together and move to the cooling step. In the condenser, 3 different steps cooperate for the process to continue. From step 6, cold water joins the system to help in the condensation process of both the steam and the oil vapor. In the 7th step, the heated water through cooling of the flowen mixture escapes out of the process. Both steps together, promotes reaching step 8, in which the water mixed with essential oil is formed.
Within the separator, the essential oil is derived from the preformed mixture and this allocates in step 10 the aromatic water and accordingly in step 9 the essential oil.",,,,,,6.5,oil plays significant role process producing perfumes charted oil participates around 50 process starting step 4 step process begins steps 1 2 3 heating water till evaporation steam forms steam flows aromatic plants gathering oil form vapor step within 5th step vaporized oil along preformed steam migrate together move cooling step condenser 3 different steps cooperate process continue step 6 cold water joins system help condensation process steam oil vapor 7th step heated water cooling flowen mixture escapes process steps together promotes reaching step 8 water mixed essential oil formed within separator essential oil derived preformed mixture allocates step 10 aromatic water accordingly step 9 essential oil
2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.
Using a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.
On the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.
To summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way.",,,,,,6.5,written language human history since many thousand years ago first developed ancient egyptians old civilizations keep history safe remembered reformed learning teaching documenting building new civilizations latin modern english enormous amount changes developments emerged things derived intent humanbeings use easier language deliver usages opinion changing language using relaxed way could destroy basis strong meanings shall deliver original form using less formal language writing could associated multiple different advantages people able write using language easier faster relaxed way compared formal version using easy version language could promotes amount written work accordingly supports idea keeping culture remembered instance amount written stories english doubled years making english easier language apply write furthermore relaxed language help many speakers learn use language faster shall increase amount people speaking specific language hand couple critical disadvantages could distinguished applying strategy written language maybe amount written ressources increased massively last couple hunderd years quality sophistication materials materials concrete concise accurate materials capturing needed knowledge within current generation successfully questions trigger easier language use neccessarily mean better documents rather massive irrelevant amount expolited work summarive tend opinion disadvantages outweigh advantages using less formal language writing perspective could significantly critisized point views shall think methodology written language helps human civilizations thrive way

I believe that uncountable reasons could be behind this awful phenomenon, and many solutions should be taken to reduce the amounts of these wasted foods and to reduce the starvation. I will mention some in this essay.
Starting from the root causes, cooking a feast for a small group of people might be considered part of any country's culture such as many countries in the golf area, or otherwise, the person would look as stingy or even a bad host. Although some people order a huge amount of food just for the purpose of bragging, sometimes it could be due to wrong estimation of the number of guests or the portion that is needed for each individual.
Nevertheless, such matter should have immediate solutions, on both personal and global level. Governments should take all actions needed to increase the awareness of the danger of this problem and its negative consequences, whether through social media platforms or through the national TV, and to find innovative ways to hold their citizens responsible for minimising such cruical issue. Moreover, individuals should always make sure to donate the extra food to any person that is in need.

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting.

This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.
The principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
A solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.
In conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food.",,,,,,6.0,wasting food slowly becoming people habit modern world essay discuss reason people wasting food suggest viable solution principal reason people unable finish dishes often take portions food cause food wasted instance buffets common place wastes tons food especially hotels hence food pick reasonable price buffet wasting food slowly becoming people habit modern world essay discuss reason people wasting food suggest viable solution principal reason people unable finish dishes often take portions food cause food wasted instance buffets commonly wasted tons food especially hotel hence food pick reasonable price buffet solution worrying problem take away leftovers back home food kept days refrigerator people cook house without going afford meals result reduce expenditure food transportation experience mother would pack leftover food bring back home result food still tastes restaurant thus family never discuss eat rest day preventing food waste bringing back home amount waste foods would never able reduce conclusion one main problems food many countries unable finish food solved taking away food back home predicted individuals taking away remaining food accommodation reduce amount waste food

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.
First and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.
Now, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.
To sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.",,,,,,7.5,living 21st century without doubt us already possess luxury everything need shelter clothes importantly food water despite sad say still handful world population remain depths poverty even many countries found guilty wasting huge amounts food essay discuss reason behind food wastage suggest solutions reduce effect first foremost people waste food belief people tend take food handle especially functions like buffets alongside weddings act many major contributers food waste general also lack awareness poverty among public blame therefore people practice consideration towards cause unfamilar unaware lack exposure knowledge impact food waste bring environment society actions take reduce amount food disposed government country leaders take first step conducting educational campaigns food wastes poverty particularly targeting school children public play significant role shedding light onto issues need addressed urgently people also strongly encouraged take sensible amount food coming back seconds avoid unecessary wastage well excess weight gain sum food wastage something proud adverse effects brought upon us humans hence quickly make much needed change help turn situation around hopefully contribute creating better society

This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.

Overall, the process involves in eight different steps which are manufacturing, delivering, unwrapping, spreading the material on the ground, the use of an air pump followed by the action of watering, setting and storing.
Firstly, the process of creating a storage area starts by manufacturing the concrete canvas which consists of three different layers: the top layer is called the fibrous top surface followed by a layer of dry concrete and a waterproof layer. Next, the material is delivered and unwrapped to be spread out on the ground surface. The spreading process involves in covering an area of 10 metres using pegs and a rope.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.
The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.
In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.
To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.",,,,,,7.5,argued individuals men skilled enough women regard leadership essay disagrees given statement leadership skills depending gender strongly related people personality work experience role leader stereotyped according gender example women might considered powerful men could normally appear organised perfectionist indeed several studies concerning leadership role leader demonstrated people innate attitudes leader regardless gender attitudes related active listening emotional intelligence skills great communication abilities thus effectively developed fostered skills support individuals achieve higher roles leadership management way working experience also plays crucial role determining developing leadership skills example large number women still renouncing career paths order care families indeed women apply roles offer opportunity achieve leadership role despite abilities reason difficult affirm women better men leadership conclude role leader shaped innate characteristics people personalities regardless gender moreover poor presence women employed leadership roles create pieces evidence support point view

The process can be outlined in eight consecutive steps, beginning with the manufacturing of the concrete canvas and culminating with storing of goods.
Firstly, the concrete canvas is produced as a three-layers composite. It consists of a fibrous top surface, a layer of dry concrete, and a waterproof layer. The features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability. The finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site, where the boxes are unwrapped, and the canvas inside is taken out.
In the next stage, the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle. In order to fix the canvas on the ground, pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas. After that, on one end of the spread canvas, a door is installed as the entrance of the storage. The covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine. Following that, water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage. Thus, the form of storage is constructed.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people’s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.",,,,,,8.0,true gender equality achieved significant advancements nowadays compared society past women doubt obtained opportunities get engaged leading role many occasions regard many success stories female leadership common statement women suited leaders opinion leadership depends ability rather gender several reasons people may consider females better choice occupy leading position firstly female leadership relatively new trend recent decades development society therefore put highlight past men always seen superior gender run company dominate realm time women seldom taken account qualified management many cases merely eligible leadership hence opportunity success female leadership nowadays highly emphasized kept firmly people minds probably leads imagination women better lead secondly statement sometimes regarded propaganda gender equality order improve public awareness female role leadership create chances women partake leading surely excellent idea set good image female leadership advocating merits however decisive factors successful leadership include capacities like communication personal charisma intelligence misinformed despite argument given also believe urgent replace stereotype gender among public contributes distinct impression gender leadership male characteristics traditionally defined braveness intelligence dominance match requirement leadership lot doubt women brave able take risks responsibility leading position well prime example female chancellor merkel germany led german government 16 years enjoyed reputation worldwide political legend reflects fact extraordinary competence leadership exclusively belong males conclusion although completely agree gender equality unparalleled importance however key successful leadership never related gender

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.
First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.
The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.
All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication.

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.
Having considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools.",,,,,,7.0,development technology debate whether advanced communication technology would major contributor worsening human relationships modern society opinion developing communication tool could negative impacts social relationships future hold opinion two reasons elaborate following essay begin new technology could control early phase introduction new technologies certainly enable us live conveniently result however often takes time fit lifestyles control latest tool could bring worsened effects society expect specific bullying use smartphone one major problems world today manifest new communication tools easily devastate human relationships regard hand arguments made new communication tools make possible people across world chat without physical moving another place closer examination would reveal introduction new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities people meet person compelling example japanese people less relationship neighborhood post people living today might satisfied tons telecommunication rather direct communication strongly suppose also negative effect social relationships use new technology considered strongly believe modern communication tools would lead negative result social relationships uncontrollable aspects latest technology loss communication person use new communication tools

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.
The rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin – now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.
Nevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.
To conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.
Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.",,,,,,6.5,development technology increasing number people try acquire latest technology computer programming rather study history debate whether studying histroy could give us advantages understand present society opinion obtaining knowledge past history would definitely helpful us live well society today hold opinion two reasons elaborate following essay begin looking back history would give us opportunity notice mistakes human beings used make past specifically kinds people countries around world made innumerable mistakes throughout history besides mistakes might result huge number victims therefore human beings must avoid tragedic events happening knowing history could lead avoidance recurrences specific world war must one serious events human history understanding truth significant impact live cause war present society manifest leaning history meaningful regard hand arguments made old stories little something present lives however closer examination would reveal relationships present today originally come something past knowing history enables us find best way fruitful future compelling example racial discrimination understanding history could give us best manner deteriorate relationships suppose studying history would helpful human beings aspect considered arguments learning history would major contributor better understanding present know avoid mistake people used made behave better result history

According to what is shown after having a ripe olive from the farms, the farmer must pick the olive and put them in cold water to clean it from particles. After that belt it and send it to a smashing machine to squeeze the olive stones. Then, the olive pastes must be packed in pages with holes to keep them fresh as long as possible.

While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.
On one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
On the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.
In conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information.

2,"Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.
The first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.
The second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.
I think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver.

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.
To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.
Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.
Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"This essay will talk about the importance or not of spending lots of money on family celebrations.
Family celebrations are always important, at least for catholics as it happens in my country, Spain. Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear. Almost every family with children receiving the communion will choose to organize a big party, inviting all family members and friends, and organizing something special for children such as going to Disneyland Park (or any other theme park). The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.
On one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.
But, I can´t see the point on spending so much money.
I have been a kid of the ""old school"". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"With the development of society, people have more options for how they spend their own money compared with the previous generations. There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.
Having all the arguments above, I strongly recommend people spend their money on family celebrations enough to make family members satisfied.",,,,,,6.0,development society people options spend money compared previous generations ongoing debate whether essential invest money family celebrations opinion spending lot money family celebration would definitely bring precious experiences us hold opinion two reasons elaborate following essay begin squandering money family significantly meaningful specifically important person us wife children may sight suddenly someday nobody predict going happen future regular appreciation toward spending lot money might enable us regret something tragic happened specific scientific report revealed deep peaceful relationship someone ended improving quality life manifest spending money family could bring us advantages regard hand arguments made paying money major contributor improving happiness however closer examination would reveal spending lot money others end bringing us loneliness lot things feel satisfied spending money others world compelling example trip someone surely good relationship enables us feel satisfaction alone suppose spending money others key making happier arguments strongly recommend people spend money family celebrations enough make family members satisfied

It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.
The basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countries’ fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.
In developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living.

There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science.

There are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. First of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. Moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.

In another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life.

However, a lot of countries have not enough students to take part in this subject. I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.
First, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.
Science influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power. All the social issues will finally affect the financial stability and cause some sorrowful tragedies.

Secondly, Religious reasons
You maybe surprised to read this however, it's actullay one of the issues that causes the lack of having enough students studying science.
The best way to explain this reason is by example where in Saudi Arabia between the 1990 until 2013 a Religious were preaching peploe about the danger of studing science and that they should only focus on religion subjects.

Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.

On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.
To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.
In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed.

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
To begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
Furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
Although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects.",,,,,,6.0,increasing interests money happened many countries worldwide obviously aguements wage income become popular topics people essay demonstrate reasons behide possible consequences followed statement begin modern world social media plays major role people younger generation particular communicate others dominant cause leading daily conversations financial issues example plenty contents posted digital platforms facebook instagram related financial knowledge perhaps normalize topics financial acceptable past furthermore luxury products become indicator social status younger generation tons advertisements involved every kinds medias people tend spend wealth artificial things instance experienced individuals saving half monthly income able purchase watch although converstions money might help people understand deeper money management improve get higher wage could lead overspendings could huge negative effect conclusion seems widely used social media advertisements luxury products two major causes rising popurlarity talking money one hand situation help equip people better knowledge money management hand daily discussions money potential raise importance external artificial objects

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,"This bar chart shows the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022.
First, there have four different types of home activities: dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. Also there have three different types of people that spent time taking care of their children in the evening.
Then, for dressing and homework, the mothers are spent their time taking care of their children (dressing: around 75%; homework: 50%); For playing games and preparing for bed, the mothers and fathers both to spent their time with their children in the evening (playing games: 70%; preparing for bed: 50%).

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).
This phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:
1. Inner hypocrisy;
2. Lack of confidence in oneself;
3. Thinking and vision.
First of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.
Secondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.
Finally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.
In a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better.",,,,,,6.0,modern society people believe money important indispensable water result many countries people talk money much earn pay things everyday conversation phenomenon think negative development three reasons inner hypocrisy lack confidence oneself thinking vision first inner hypocrisy many young people like talk friends much earn many expensive things buy college reunion everyone introduce example kind work recently bought house car somewhere recommend others core purpose say made millions years bought house car although look nice outside empty inside therefore inner hypocrisy empty heart nothing else compare others use money make satisfy inner emptiness others find sense existence recognition attention secondly confident many elderly people like chat children playing cards community pavilion example child married much child earn month child buy anything expensive answer negative looked upon even saying children working long hours little money buy anything nice people often talk confident know children inferior abilities aspects words uncertain reckless like show front want prove ability finally thinking vision high every country place different classes people living rural china paternal lived past surface look good every way material things think money important money lot things money give sense security seen person circle friends living environment determine person thinking vision surroundings positive attract positive people like word person always talks money shows hypocritical inside confident thinking vision high sure constantly improve thinking vision constantly improve ability aspects even keep positive times attract people like also future life better

First, dressing had a relatively extreme situation. There were the highest figure that mothers spent about 75% of time in dressing of their children. However, fathers only spent 3% of time in it showing the lowest figure. Second, fathers spent 10% of time in doing homwork with their children, which was the most popular event of fathers.

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.
Money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.
However, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying ""freedom"" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.
In summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money.",,,,,,6.5,face people love talk money income price things modern society view reasons physical mental aspects bring negative effect develop deeply money required live society limited ability earn money therefore realistically us avoid count money spend also macro view government also care figure gpd issues every year measuring wealth country populace pay attention international state country also welfare people regarding mental reasons people generally think ability earning money related success life moreover people like competition always compare level income friends companions however think negative development people deeply concentrate first agree money everything human embodying freedom highest value live believe accomplishing mental achievements important physical target otherwise people become heartless think money criteria measuring useful human example help take care others volunteers without payment turn topic conversation money life summary although money necessary daily life turn us ruthless control well meaningful events friends rather talking much money

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"As we are living into a monetary society, it's unavoidable for people to discuss about money matters in daily conversation about housing mortgage, salaries and other living expenses. The financial anxiety has become a main source of headache that lingers on especially for the young generation who has to bear the increasing burden of a city life. From a standpoint of a college student, I believe it's not a postive development that should have occurred in our modern society.
When our conversation turns to money issues, it doesn's really help up with our status quo, but only further exacerbates social anxiety by unnecessay comparison and higher expectation. I personally have similar experiences when friends start to talk about their monthly pocket money and daily luxuries they prefer. We are widely variated in family background, social classes and opportunities. If our daily social discourses are always filled with monetary issues, it is only widening the social gaps between different groups of people and making our society a place less inclusive for underprevilaged people.
Additionally, money-oriented conversations might as well shape our world perspective into a very pratical, highly self-interested and boring one, which is full of daily trifles and calculation. In book The Little Prince, he says adult will only appreciate a house when you tell them that it is worth a million pounds. It exactly depicts the moderntime conversations that value things more a monetary basis.

We are neither willing nor prepared to see a world where romance can be purchased, friendship ca be transacted and even life itself has a certain value that can be measured in dollars.

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.
Two major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.
On the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.
Although the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.
To conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors. However, the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis.",,,,,,8.5,material achievement discussed high frequency countries people widely involve topic every aspect lives essay give two possible reasons phenomenon explain negative impacts society two major causes keep people lingering topic firstly difficulties earning living countries significantly drawn people focus finance instance job opportunities needed job seekers countries low productivity besides many countries people endure low pay extreme cases earnings cover spending therefore tremendous anxiety cause people countries constantly talk financial situations side flaunting becoming mainstream mindset countries commonly countries escaped poverty increasing spared money makes showing possible people countries display wealth owning luxurious items branded bags jewelry therefore money naturally becomes essential conversations although reasons money focusing vary might develop risky societal factors frequent discussion finance due insufficient employment inadequate wages alarm governments carry measures boosting industries development otherwise riots might expected harm social safety furthermore widespread discussion highly leads material comparison harms morality even allows crimes occur individuals obsess showing feel shame disposing downsides maintain perfect especially wealthy appearance people even turn crime stealing robbery conclude folks popularly discuss money various reasons demands work psychological factors however phenomenon positive sign society likely indicates upcoming crisis

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.
To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.
In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This
means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.
Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, I could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.
To begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. In this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. For example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.
On the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. Take the UK as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.
To summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. However, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. Therefore, I could only partially agree with such opinions.",,,,,,6.0,regarding suggestions governments offord tuition subsidies cover cost full classes could partially agree due various drawbacks derived policies begin higher educational levels essential young individuals poor families reverse situation families case governments obligations ensure right pursue higher education without financial concerns example many university students nowadays one jobs since need support financially left time concentrate studies hand despite free ethic education could benefit great number students need huge costs maintain functional educational institution overlooked removing tuition fee universities completely could derives various downsides including lower quality education slower progresses local constructions developments caused shortage budgets take uk example private schools able provide educational materiols professional educators compared public schools high tendency classes outdated teaching equipments summerrise perspective right students study universities crucial since could cultivates talents able contribute societies allows bring families poverty however people ignoranced negative affects derived removing tuition fee entirely poor quality teaching therefore could partially agree opinions

The population in Indonesia is the most numerous in all the periods we are comparing.

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.
There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.
And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.
If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.
In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.
The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.
To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.
Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.",,,,,,5.5,essay agrees need governments pay full course fees students want study universities always one premise students demonstrated capability comply university studies successfully countries example scandinavian countries government helps students giving specific students loans loans special characteristics long loan terms low interest rates free least higher number students access upgrade studies many european countries university fees large students access bachelor studies easy needed qualification need access specific university study want talk worlwide terms university studies limited wealthy people fact read couple weeks ago 17 worlds population university studies contradiction developped non developped countries example countries europe many university students actually find job easily country sometimes emigrate another country europe outside europe furthermore vocational workers plumbers waiters receptionists ca found unemployment vocational work opposite happens non developped countries university studies large fees almost nobody access vocational workers suffer unemployment need emigrate countries find jobs summarize believe fees obstacle study university obstable previous califications education health much country hold available population poor wealthy non differentiation

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.
On the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.
On the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.
In summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.",,,,,,7.0,education important requirement students establishing future thus considerable debate whether government give fully supported payment university courses people want study view partially agree statement beneficial scheme selection scheme participants required filtering really need assistance one hand definite good plan families low income completed bachelor degree course may cost 10 thousand dollars however grassroots families hard afford may tend study universities find job earning money college may lose potentially intelligent students therefore scheme implemented successfully students show ingenuity get higher academic achievement finally giving back society succeed hand scheme suitable everyone qualification checking needed choosing someone truly aspires opportunity study college example setting line indicating limit monthly income family way government distinguish needed help cost study also type inspiration students studying harder family proven able afford fees government would give assistance order avoid abusive use summary although scheme advantageous families revealing children inherent power government set rules filtering necessary help

First of all, the most important government task is guarantee a better level of basic education. So having great public schools to fundamental level, enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship, when it is necessary. Governments shouldn't spend public money in graduation or higher level education, in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education.
Another public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven't enouth money to pay full tuition fees. These type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they've concluded the course.

Unfortunatly, this is an expensive task that not everyone can afford. Thit is the reason why some people think that governments should pay course fees for university students.

They find it amazing because, now they are not only defined by their parents' income anymore, and they have the opportunity to accomplish whatever they wish in life.
Secondly, an enormous amount of students live in a precarous situation, so by paying their course fees they could have a more stable life.

By paying some of their fees, students could benefit from the money and do what they enjoy. This could help them mentally and make them enjoy life a bit more.
On the other hand, I can understand that if governments had to pay for the course fees of every students, it would represent a tremendous amount of money that could be invested in other and more pressing matters.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.

Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.
Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers
On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.
As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well.

On the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not. I remember that in that time were a lot of discussion in TV and in the internet,
On the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example ""eurovision"" or ""olympic games"" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live. For example, in 2018 Russia hosted a world football games, and this event invited a large number of foreign specialists and investors.

They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.
On the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy.

For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.
Contrarily, there’s the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy.

In general, the unemployment situation in the urban as well as rural areas for four consecutive quarters is demonstrated in the graph.
Firstly, it is observed from this graph that the percentage of the unemployment rate was higher in rural areas than it was in urban areas. For example, the unemployment rate for the people living in rural areas of Australia in 2012 was around 7 percent whereas the residents in the urban areas faced the same crisis by 2%. Besides, the challenge of unemployment was vivid throughout the second and third quarters for both urban and rural areas. However, the situation fluctuated at the end of the fourth quarter when the unemployment ratio reached 5 percent for both areas.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","A group of people believes that students should learn food science at school whereas other groups perceive the idea of gaining knowledge on necessary subjects. Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.
The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.
However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.
In my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard. However, knowledge of subjects such as science, business studies, and arts is inevitable to achieve success in the future.

However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters. I believe academic and non-academic subjects should be balanced, and this essay will explain both views.
Human brain development makes our kids learn many things in the early phase. Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.
Nevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.

While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.

Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.

However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.
With regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.
In order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.

This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.
One of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked “cool” and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.
Even though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.
Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.
I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.
In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.",,,,,,7.0,easy find someone smokes today society even though taught smoke harmful see people exhaling thick fog everyday partly people think cool purchased almost every store essay discuss deeply causes people smoke issue alleviated firstly part society believes trendy smoke many pop culture songs movies novels portray smoking possitively comedy show seen illustrates one character smokes cool giving character untouchable aura whilst characters smoke seem tangible therefore mundane furthermore cigarettes easily accessable store recent study proved 80 eager smoke first time actually started behavior buy local shops trend pop culture convenience accessing smoke adds reasons people continues habit believe solutions tackle reduce smoking beginning medias portray smoking consequences relatable movie seen showed protagonist constant need cigarette throughout show however end finally unites crush develops severe disease mainly smoking habits regretted end method portraying people smoke totally made younger niece scared smoking addition government control accessibility cigarettes policies result fewer stores able sell cigarettes increasing tax pricing smoke kind definitely make smoking less convenient many people conclusion although many people knew harmful smoking many people think cool smoke convenient easy buy making smoking less trendy society harder access believe smoking less attractive hence reducing number smokers society

First of all, the most striking information is that China appears to be the main country in which pollution is highly present, in the 3 different areas, during the given period. In fact, their levels of pollution ranged between 60 to 80 PPM, and none of the other countries even reached 60 PPM in terms of pollution during 2021.
In 2021, China displayed the highest level of pollution related to electricity generation compared to the other countries. In fact, it was double of America's, as it meant 60 PPM in China. However, although China showed again the highest level of transport pollution with 70 PPM, America was not very far from that figure as it was just under 60 PPM, while Japan was half, and Australia did not even reach 20 PPM.
Finally, industry pollution in China was even bigger than the other areas, as it reached the highest point with 80 PPM. However, even though Japan was largely behind America and China in terms of electricity and transport pollution, it was the second country of indutry pollution, but it was roughly half of China's. America was under that with just under 30 PPM, and Australia displayed even less than that slightly under 20 PPM.
To conclude, China is clearly the country that demonstrated the highest levels of pollution in each given areas, even though America was close to their level of transport pollution at that time.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.
Evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.
However, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.

This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.

Electricity generated air pollution the least in the country, but it was still higher than other three countries (just below 60 PPM). However, Australia, generated air pollution from the three activities at just below 20 PPM.
America produced air pollution from transport (at just under 60 PPM), followed by electricity generation (at just over 30 PPM), and industry at just under 30 PPM.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people smoke although they know how harmful smoking is. This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation.",,,,,,6.5,many people smoke although know harmful smoking essay believes smokers continue smoke addicted nicotine smoke cigarettes government launch campaign saying smoking make smokers become nasty unpleasant help reduce smoking society many smokers stop smoking addicted nicotine cigarettes smoked nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed calm smoke makes addicted smoke feel need relax example many people smoke feel stressed smoke feel relaxed get new work ideas according many smoking survey reports difficult smokers quit smoking government responsibility help make smoking situation country better government launch campaign makes smoking habit nasty unpleasant country smoking habit acceptable society smokers want least public want accepted friends people society example thailand government launches smoking campaign saying smokers smell bad makes smokers uncomfortable smoke want smelly people unfriended people conclusion people continue smoke nicotine addiction important government take serious action releasing campaign help society deal situation

Overall, there are two features; while China suffered most severely from all three elements, Australia had the least air pollution.
To be more specific, Chinese air pollution was by far the worst in 2021. Among the three factors, industry pollution hit as much as 80 PPM, which was nearly two times as large as that in Japan. China's air pollution caused by electricity generation is the smallest among the three factors in China. Nevertheless, it was almost 60 PPM and approximately double that in the United States of America.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Although it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.
First of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.
Secondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.
There are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax.",,,,,,7.0,although well known smoking causes severe damage bodies many people reduce bad habit big problem many people die lung cancer every year social welfare expenditures expensive point many people continue smoke let stop smoking essay provide two reasons related examples solve questions first people addicted smoking stop smoking without help experience father heavy smoker wanted quit smoking could thus went hospital met counselor father got advice medicine could cut bad habit therefore counselor help definitely necessary secondly cigarettes still relatively cheap compared alcohol instance tobacco reasonable japan home country several decades ago thus many people habit smoking rather drinking alcohol japanese government raised tax rate cigarettes 20 percent 50 percent order strongly discourage people smoking consequently smoking rate dropped dramatically japan case shows rise tax rate quite effective reducing smoking country probably many people different opinions disagree way thinking however considering two specific reasons related examples indicated personally believe addiction low price two main factors smoking remedies counselor advice raise tax

Although
there are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.
Initially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.
On the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class
everyday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.
Finally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.

Many said ""yes"" and many said ""no"". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let's compare them wisely.
On the ""homework is bad for students” side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.
On the other hand, ""homework is good for students'' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.
If students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.
Personally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.
From my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.
Having said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.

Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support children´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.
Having homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.
On the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.

The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.
Firstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.
Secondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.
All things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed.

Overall, the lifecycle occurs over a five step repeating series, starting with the mating of the male and female honey bee and finalising once the honey bee as fully matured into an adult. This cycle lasts a total period of 34-36 days.
In the inital stage, the male and female honey bee mate with one another. Once inpregnated, the maternal bee lays around 1 to 2 eggs on a flat surface. This process takes place after a period of three days and is repeated as such on each third day. Next, the layed eggs hatch once they've reached their 9th or 10th day of life, giving rise to the newly born nymph. The nymph then moults three times during it's growth and development, at days 5, 7 and 9 respectively, until it has matured into a young adult.

Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.
Firstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.
However, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.
To conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come.",,,,,,5.5,since industrial revolution economy continued expand develop impressive increasing rate hence many goverments worldwide believe primary objective focus development goods services others however argue sectors progress equal value thus similar effort made across board essay discuss although focus economic progress benefical country believe similar emphasis put sectors greater civilisation whole firstly undisbutable fact govermental bodies contributing growth industries provides better quality life money distributed businesses industries allows grow expand offering employment oppurtunities greater availabilty services example ireland 19th century era tiger goverment supplied yearly budget towards economy turn saw country saw overall downfall unemployment rate contrast manufactoring establishment bussiness across counties thus highlights contributing towards economy boosts living standards however order contribute nations development achieved one sectors progress alone believed many putting emphasis fields instance education transport health better country whole example japan saw increase employment rates local government began contribute spendings towards expansion third level instituitions better academic background encouraged people actually seek employnment already established businesses would ever dreamed holding diploma turn rippling effect across generations standards living continues surge additionally governements aiding better health transport availabilty evidentely aid better development nation means travelling work similarly means take greater care improve quality life people across region conclude economic growth process one continues rise date governments believe key goal progress area however opinion equally aiding sectors education transport health impact economies growth better quality lives generations come

Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.
To start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.
Having said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.

It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.
First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.
Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.

I think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.
Continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
Also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
Like ones president Benito Juárez said ""The respect to the right of others is the peace"".
When i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
So also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.
These could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it.",,,,,,5.0,taking bullying important every day think days society experiencing transformation values transformation lot thes important values saturating get forgotten think first solution come house parents critical parents properly informed situation correct preparation handel continuing idea first step come house school child attending could give seminary bulling consequences inform parents school zero tolerance cases also think make aware child situation talk explain good bullying someone race color way think tell show maturity learn respect different thinking people like ones president benito juárez said respect right others peace elementary term around mean bulling exist may days common someone bulling another student times happened students stand selves also teach child learn defend tolerate type behavior tache always come talk help solve types situations also wittnes type behavior indifferent take posture defend child could going authority teacher principal etc try stop

This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.
First, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.
Also, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.
These phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find ""Pride and Prejudice"" unfamiliar, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" alien to them.
People losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.
To sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy.",,,,,,6.5,nowadays seems people willing dedicate time hobbies pastimes essay state specific examples analyze consequences first literature fans declining sharply decades people willingly invested considerable time energy reading studying jean austin charles dickens literature clubs appealing constantly filled true shakespear lovers among real experts unfortunately recent time book stores favor complete works dickens make much profit many literature clubs doors shut due members greatly decreased also obvious sports losing popularity instace even 5 years ago much devoted football fans almost every football club considerable number faithful fans people happy anticipate match results purchase match tickets lotteries however case people reluctant stay stadium watching football match proven constant nearly empty statiums phenomena bring several negative effects individuals society first many people lose ability appreciating masterpieces great authors like listed moreover would fewer parents like buy children novels austin selective works shakespear thus among next generation much people may find pride prejudice unfamiliar romeo juliet alien people losing interest sports heavy blow economy fans watch matches football clubs would brink bankcrupt government also lose great amount tax derived sports industry sum acknowledge people tend hate devote much time hobbies including literature football cause negative effects like losing appreciating abilities causing problems economy

Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit.

Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.
Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.

Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays everyone is suffering from the lack of time. People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.
Needless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.
On the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.

2,"Write about the following topic.Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn’t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.
It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.
Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can’t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.
To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety.",,,,,,7.5,undoubtedly case world become global village nowadays cooperations different countries exist almost every occasion result inevitably large amounts information exchanged shared various usages however access information remained one debatable issues people believe information shared without restriction others insist foremost information exchanged free view appropriate measures costs taken protect valuable information abused stolen fairly easy understand view people favor exchanging information much possible improve quality research guarantee success cooperation usually necessary share resources exchange minds furthermore amount shared information often decisive time result sometimes might eagerly expected example almost unimaginable vaccine covid 19 quickly created without intensive international cooperation contains enormous sum shared knowledge experience diverse field governments universities benefit sharing period vaccine take ten years past immensely shortened time quality vaccine also prestigious world nevertheless information could also harmful risky every possibility information importance value misused eventually leads severe problems intention usage proven legal righteous risk information leakage exists sharing example classified military information hacked terrorists governments two countries sharing discussing military intelligence result horrible disaster treats citizens therefore necessary take measures protect safety sensitive information unauthorized access sum sharing information certainly helpful meaningful improving wide variety cooperation however also urgent pay attention sharing sensitive information order guarantee safety

Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?
Firstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.
Traffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.
However, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.
In my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that?

1,"The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.","The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.
To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.
Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes.

2,Write about the following topic.Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.
To begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.
On the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.
In conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online.",,,,,,8.0,recent years advancement technology elevating quality life customers worldwide however issue hand consumers face difficulties choosing products companies surging numbers advertisements rival companies essay examine extent customers impacted advertisements suggest viable methods protect customers begin think customers significantly influenced advertisements viewed highest extent emotional buyers affected although consumers believe watching mcdonald advertisement tv neccesarily encourage purchase foods mcdonalds continously watching mcdonald advetisements repetitive manner subconsciously revert customer attention order foods mcdonalds hungry late nights 2016 study harvard university professor oak mentioned 75 consumers view imageries advertising began implementing part lives result become obese another point worth mentioning rival companies tend create illusion trust towards products loyal colgate customer toothpaste brand convinced oral b advertisements another toothpaste brand product better potentially choose oral b rely permanently despite fact flaws product hence customers become emotionally manipulated contrary number profound methodology prevent increasing numbers advertisements influencing customers one notable ones government limit number advertisements published although advertising company may lose attention customers due lack marketing many customers able focus lesser advertisements wastes significantly less time therefore able enjoy time watching movie series love moreover another important solution government investigate advertisement products displayed online instance countries baby milk powder replaced dangerous chemicals resulted food poisoning babies caused severe trauma consumers mianly family members worldwide implementing stricter control towards advertisement products customers able reap rewards best products move life yales university states enhancing quality advertising campaigns despite rivalry betweem companies customers able protect manipulation marketing schemes therefore customers safe misleading products conclusion believe consumers significantly influenced advertisements viewed highest extent create illusion trust towards products also viable measures protect customers government limiting number advertisements shown investigating advertisement products displayed online

People who are unemployed and retired have more leisure time than people with other employment status. For the these two cases, the number of hours of leisure time enjoyed by men is about 90 hours per week, which is slightly higher than that of women who have about 70 hours of leisure time per week.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.
The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks
and even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.
For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.
In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time.

On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character.

Overall, it can be seen that three companies, Samsung, Apple, And ZTE increased their sales, while two companies, Nokia and LG feld down their sale.
Initially, Nokia used to be the highest sales of the other companies in 2009. It was specially close to 450 and it doubled to the second-highest sales Samsung. Then the sales figure slightly dwindled to approximately 400 in 2011, but they kept the highest sales figure. But the sales figure suddenly plummeted to 250 and resulted in the second highest sales among five companies in 2013. LG is also slightly kept reducing the sales figure and slightly dropped the sales. It was more than 100 in 2009, and hit the lowest point of around 70 in 2013.
Another notable feature is that Samsung started their sales figure around 200 in 2009, and kept boosting sales steadily. As a result, Samsung reached a peak of sales 450 and the highest sales around the world in 2013. A similar phenomenon occurred at Apple. Apple used to be the worst sales in 2009.

And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.
It is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.
On the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.
Finally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.
In conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes.

At the bottom of the stopbank a floodgate is allocated so that water can pass to the internal pond underneath the house without touching it and a bem is situated to the water side which can open and close depending on the water level.

Nowadays, living together before deciding to get married, is a common trend specially by young couples. I strongly agree that sharing a life before heading to the next level of a relationship, is a positive way to get to learn each other better.
First and foremost, by living together the couple will learn some of the bad habit the other one has such as brushing the teeth in the kitchen sink, leave the dishes in the sink for another time to clean them and more. It is important, that the person is aware of such behaviour, so when they get married, it is not a surprise. Additionally, the individual has enough time to deal with it or to make a negative decision. Moreover, they can talk about it and look together for solutions.
By living together the individuals share the bills and other invoices. Thus, they will find out if the other one is reliable and able to pay the bills on time. There is enough evidence, that the finances are a challenge in many relationships. You want to make sure that the bills are paid on time. In many relationships, the individuals share a bank account specifically to pay invoices, trust a priority, indeed. For example, you do not want to need to pay for your expenses and the bank account is emptied by your partner.
On the other hand, in many conservative cultures and societies, people can only move together after marriage. The individuals do not know whom they will be sharing their lives. Thus, much has to be learnt and accepted due to the fact, that getting divorced is not accepted.
To sum up, living together before getting married has a myriad of advantages. Thus, I am of the view, that it is beneficial to live together and get to learn each other well before taking the next step.",,,,,,7.0,past couples moved together getting married choice nowadays living together deciding get married common trend specially young couples strongly agree sharing life heading next level relationship positive way get learn better first foremost living together couple learn bad habit one brushing teeth kitchen sink leave dishes sink another time clean important person aware behaviour get married surprise additionally individual enough time deal make negative decision moreover talk look together solutions living together individuals share bills invoices thus find one reliable able pay bills time enough evidence finances challenge many relationships want make sure bills paid time many relationships individuals share bank account specifically pay invoices trust priority indeed example want need pay expenses bank account emptied partner hand many conservative cultures societies people move together marriage individuals know sharing lives thus much learnt accepted due fact getting divorced accepted sum living together getting married myriad advantages thus view beneficial live together get learn well taking next step
1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","The diagrams show the way in which the flooding of houses may be prevented by constructing them upon raised foundations, so that the floor of the house is separated from the highest probable water level (considering a period of 100 years) by at least 300 millimeters (30 centimeters). This distance is called ""freeboard.""
The first diagram shows how this may be accomplished in situations in which the house is located between a stopbank -that is, a barrier separating the river or drain from the area in which the house is located- and a hill or otherwise elevated area from which rainwater may run downhill (a phenomenon known as ""internal runoff""), potentially creating a pond in the area in which the house stands. In such a situation, the diagram shows that the stopbank should be higher than the 100-year flood level, although it does not show the minimum clearance required. At the same time, the house should be high enough that its floor is at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year ponding level.
The second diagram shows the way in which the house should be protected from floods in situations where there is no stopbank. In such cases, the house should simply be raised to a height at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood level. The second diagram does not show the effects of any internal runoff.

2,Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.
I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.
In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.
Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.
What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.",,,,,,9.0,many people believe may advisable couples live together getting married may lead smoother relationship married tend agree opinions find arguments usually support quite reasonable example commonly said people act differently home outside people instinctively tend relaxed home whereas social situations usually make effort even unconsciously likable conceal less agreeable aspects personality others even partners usual hear one truly know someone one lived person extreme cases cohabitation marriage could even prevent couples entering marriage bound fail lead unhappiness considering possibility seems reasonable marriage emotional bond also legal one undoing usually upsetting costly another reason find cohabitation marriage sensible choice minor disagreements conflicts usually inevitable first months cohabitation preferable pass stage getting married add problems period already stressful weeks ceremony weeks following said point reflects opinion must noted put practice got married indeed wife decided move together weeks ceremony decision due fact family quite moving together would undoubtedly caused pain even reasons would understood degree persuasion would avoided removed pain found benefits stable close relationship family important discomfort moving together ultimately decided ceremony planned
1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.","The diagram illustrates the effect of a stopbank in frequently flooded areas.
Overall, a stopbank divides the land from the rive or the drain and contributes to the formation of an internal ponding system on land. Houses can be built lower in areas with a stopbank.
It is clearly shown in the diagram that house floor level in areas without a stopbank must be 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood or ponding level. However, house floor level in areas with a stopbank can be much lower, even under the 100-year flood level.

2,Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Couples living together before their weddings was once deemed as a disgrace. However, as our society keeps developing, more and more people start to accept the idea of cohabitation and put it into action. Admittedly, cohabitation can be advantageous. However, I do believe that people need to exercise caution when making the decision of living together with a partner.
It is true that living together with one's partner is a great opportunity for couples to know their partners as well as life after marriage better. Lovers tend to love each other so much that they can easily miss some tiny but crucial details or habits of their significant other. Cohabitation makes these details and habits unavoidable since two people are basically seeing each other for hours on a daily basis. Cohabitation can also be a buffer to help young couples move into a new stage in their lives. However, despite the fact that people are expected to completely understand their husband or wife-to-be as well as marriage itself, it is not guaranteed that they will still make the decision to marry that person after cohabitation.
Some people find it difficult or even dangerous to put the idea of cohabitation into implementation. Lovers in a long-distance relationship, for example, usually reside in different cities and can only see each other once in a while. In such situations, cohabitation means that one person must give up his or her career. This seems to be unfair and may lead to unnecessary breakups. Another instance is that some people can use cohabitation to, financially or sexually, take advantage of other people.
All in all, many advantages can be attributed to cohabitation, but I still think that people need to be cautious before moving in with a partner.",,,,,,7.5,couples living together weddings deemed disgrace however society keeps developing people start accept idea cohabitation put action admittedly cohabitation advantageous however believe people need exercise caution making decision living together partner true living together one partner great opportunity couples know partners well life marriage better lovers tend love much easily miss tiny crucial details habits significant cohabitation makes details habits unavoidable since two people basically seeing hours daily basis cohabitation also buffer help young couples move new stage lives however despite fact people expected completely understand husband well marriage guaranteed still make decision marry person cohabitation people find difficult even dangerous put idea cohabitation implementation lovers relationship example usually reside different cities see situations cohabitation means one person must give career seems unfair may lead unnecessary breakups another instance people use cohabitation financially sexually take advantage people many advantages attributed cohabitation still think people need cautious moving partner

In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.
A sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.
However, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to children’s school marks, but for themselves.
Moreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.
To my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.
Consequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home.",,,,,,7.0,accurately assessing best way teaching children easy task comes comparing taking lesson home school issue becomes even complicated figure essay going explain two main views people hold subject sizeable number people argue children would best served taught home rather turning school highly comfortable utterly familiar environment allow involved attending lessons well assignments effectively reducing distractions result thanks children may enough time spent leisure sport activities however many others beg differ claiming laptop replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances since lack direct relationship specific stage age might detrimental children school marks moreover hold current thought contend come cost concentration comforting background may shift children focus toward appealing activities standing stark contrast former view aforementioned mind believe covid experience provided insight could help us take stock situation vein namely flurry psychological ailments children suffering lockdown mostly sparked isolation toward peers found consequently means relationship restriction would lead depression turn affects mental processes underlying school performances overall hence reasonable think children better studying school along mates rather reclusive way alone home

I am a strong advocate that children must go to school for a variety of reasons, wich will be mentioned in this essay.
To commence with, eventhough it is important to get a proper education and this can be found in both schools and at home, however, going to school on a daily basis can garantee the kid to communicate with his/her peers. And this can be in a negative or positive way- nowadays, but no matter which way the kid experiences, it is still going to be an experience that the kid will develop and learn from after. And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...
Likewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.

Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.
On the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of children’s study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.
On the other hand, it perhaps better for children’s development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their “green house” once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.

While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.

Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.
To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.
Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.

2,Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.
To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.
Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.
To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society.

Love and being in the relationships depend on people' s mutual feeling. There is no boundaries of love, even they have same gender or different races, or even speak the different languages. Therefore, if they decided to settle down and live the rest of their lives together, the social determinants will be no longer to influence the relationship.

Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.
Certainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.
People supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.
People opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea.
Firstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.
On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.
Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop.",,,,,,6.0,people strongly blame government control rise obesity children although government needs take responsibility extent disagree idea firstly people need consider needs take responsibility raising children obviously parents means parents gave well controlled balanced nutritious food children would possible prevent rise obesity therefore parents need consider children health top priority instead criticizing government therefore parents first need master cooking hand countries face high percentage obesity children higher developed countries means food contains much sugar might sold cheaper healthy food vegetable chicken fish therefore parents suffering poverty tend choose cheaper unhealthy food understandable governments need control prices healthy food much sugar fat contained food finally opinion however food contains much sugar fat high calories cheaper parents need consider children health first priority although government controlled food prices unhealthy food wholesome food parents continued choosing unhealthy food never cooked meals rise obesity children remains therefore important point parents need educate nutrition observe children diet learned made effort provide healthy food children percentage obesity drastically drop

While both have effects on the childs habits from an early age, i think that it is mostly the parents fault.
It is debated that childhood obesity is mainly the parents responsibility for various reasons. Many parents schedueles and lifestyles are not fit for having a child as their routines are not flexible enough to properly take care of him/her. For example, in most western houses, both the mother and the father have jobs to attend everyday, and dont return home to their children till the late afternoon. By that time, the parents will both be too exausted to properly look after their child, which will lead to him/her eating any food no matter its quality and source such as fast foods and sweets, which are calorie dense and low volume. Furthermore, studies have shown that around 42 percent of parents in the United States did not care what their child consumed given it was cheap and does not require preparation. As far as i am concerned, this is enough evidence to justify it being mostly the parents fault.
On the other hand, others argue that it is primarely the governments fault. Governments have complete control over what advertisements can or cannot be portrayed to the public. Knowing that most advertisements we see are related to fast food chains and chocolate bars, we can deduce that it undoubtebly has a major effect on children which will beg their parents. to try some of this food. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that fast foods contain substances which encourage addiction. So when fast foods are easily accesible no matter which city you are in, parents will have a hard time controlling which foods their children eat. I agree that the government has a major influence on children, but their parents have greater controll over them.
In conclusion, while the government is undoubtebly the root of obesity amongst children, it is completely up to the parents to either develop this problem or put limitations to it.",,,,,,7.5,individuals say children obesity fault parents others argue strictly governments fault effects childs habits early age think mostly parents fault debated childhood obesity mainly parents responsibility various reasons many parents schedueles lifestyles fit child routines flexible enough properly take care example western houses mother father jobs attend everyday dont return home children till late afternoon time parents exausted properly look child lead eating food matter quality source fast foods sweets calorie dense low volume furthermore studies shown around 42 percent parents united states care child consumed given cheap require preparation far concerned enough evidence justify mostly parents fault hand others argue primarely governments fault governments complete control advertisements portrayed public knowing advertisements see related fast food chains chocolate bars deduce undoubtebly major effect children beg parents try food addition scientifically proven fast foods contain substances encourage addiction fast foods easily accesible matter city parents hard time controlling foods children eat agree government major influence children parents greater controll conclusion government undoubtebly root obesity amongst children completely parents either develop problem put limitations

First of all, the most striking information is that the vast majority of the products in the United Kingdom are burned, which is clearly not the case in Republic of Korea as well as in Sweden, who tend to use more ecological processes.
To begin, the United Kingdom use incineration for their waste products in 82% of the cases. It's quite the contrary in the other countries, because Sweden uses this technique only for a fifth of their products. It's even less the case in the Republic of Korea, which is slightly under 10%.
Secondly, recycling is a big part of how products are processed in Korea as it represents almost two third of the techniques that they use. In Sweden a quarter of the waste products are recycled, which represents only 2% in the UK.
Finally, the UK gets rid of 16% of their products by dumping them at sea or by chemical treatment which are techniques that do not exist in the other countries. In fact, in Korea, roughly a fifth of the products are buried undergound, while more than the half are treated as the same way in Sweden.

As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people.",,,,,,7.0,nowadays obesity increasingly affecting children result put health stake obesity strong negative effects nevertheless believe governments responsible rise obesity children often warn people avoid unhealthy food advise stay good physical condition promoting physical activity one hand people claim governements responsible phenomenon prevent big companies fast food like mac donald spreading country result think children increasingly attracted type food however agree argument example usa governement invested lot money promotion organic food children fact advertisements seen regularly tv moreover lot canteens schools america obliged propose healthy menus contain organic food children order keep good health hand people argue governments keen making profit prefer promote tv programms children addictive rather physical activity consequently young people want sport move constantly gain weight easily nevertheless find argument relevant evidence shows children active ever nowadays instance france government constructed 50 000 sport facilities country 10 past years brought significant increase children practice sports regularly conclude conviced governments world putting lot efforts order prevent children obesity since promoted organic food well physical activity young people

However, there are both truth and falsehoods in this controversial statement, which will be discussed in this essay.
A lot of people may agree with this because they think that the government does not take measures to stop selling high sugar products, which may cause obesity, in schools. Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet.

Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet.

India has a very large population. Secondly, people's lifetime is longer in France. And most of the females can live a longer life than males. And there are many more women than men who can live to the age of eighty-five. However, Generally speaking , In India, people can live to over 70 years old. So in a whold, Indian people live shorter than Frenchmen. At last, let's see the newborns. In France the number of babies are smaller, but the number of people aging 50 years old is larger, which shows that France is now facing the ageing

Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile thing to do, but children shouldn't be given too much pressure.
Students in school usually have 5-6 classes, and after school they need develop their hobbies and have more time to do outdoor activities with their friends or classmates. In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.
My son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes. Kids need improve and learn new skills so as to have a better and brighter future, extra classes are needed ,but not too many or not too heavy. Be a whole person and be themselves is more important.",,,,,,5.0,development society people paying attention children education every parent hopes kids better skilled face challenges future time extra classes came besides lessons school children attend different kinds extra classes classes sports maths languages arts opinion worthwhile thing children given much pressure students school usually classes school need develop hobbies time outdoor activities friends classmates class get knowledge teachers textbooks school learn experiencing life getting nature make connections social skills think students extro classes studing knowledge experencing developing make become whole person son active boy loves sports riding horses play badminton swimming chose take club horse riding tuesday school thursday go attend swiming class friends learn swimming skills teacher aslo geat fun always see smiling face found sports hobbies really make kids feel relaxed instead bored extra maths languages classes kids need improve learn new skills better brighter future extra classes needed many heavy whole person important

There is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related.

Sometimes, the intensive courses are arranged by parents to their children study at the weekends. As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes.
My take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only.

While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.
When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.
Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.

Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
Nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.
In contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of “ may the best man win”.
However, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.

To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.
Firstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.
On the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).
In conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views.",,,,,,7.5,many regard team sports football basketball better choices sport still stick individual sports point view prefer individual sports team sports latter harmful less beneficial physical mental perspective firstly think sports played groups tend cause harm forms stress injuries start virtually team sports played competitions must winnner loser losers since one wish stepstone champion causes tremendous amount stress players psyche also many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts players competitive nature sports often intensify contact leads injuries many famous sportsmen like jianlian yi one two chinese basketball players nba forced retire early due injuries sustained matches hand individual sports like swimming joggling issues since one swim run alone need compete others cause stress removal physical contact players also reduce likelihood sport injuries collisions plus one would focus phyiscal abilities moreover individual sports like joggling hiking encourage people explore mother nature according study done ubc 2005 higher exposure nature one lesser likelihood suffer mental disorders major depressions disorder mdd general anxiety disorder gad conclusion would say sports played individually benefits team sports physical mental point views

2,Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.
Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.
On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.

Looking at the detail, at the beginning the food price index and the oil price started at about 90 points and a little less than $30 per barrel respectively. These figures then gradually increased until during 2007 to the middle of 2008 the record jumped from around 140 points to above 220 points for the food index and soared approximately three times for the oil price.

2,Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many teachers believe that an international exchange program would benefit all adolescent students. While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.
To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.
With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,"The diagram describes the map of a proposed village, although its name remains unknown. Overall, it is evident that the town will be configured around a central square, which will be mostly used as a parking lot.
Most buildings of the future town will be used as dwellings. Currently, there are 16 housing units that will be constructed both inside and outside the ring roads. Additionally, there are plans to build at least 5 recreational areas, so children and their families could spend time together while relaxing and playing. This will improve the citizens' quality of life.
Not all the areas of the proposed village, however, will be residential buildings and parks. At least 2 entire blocks will be used as industry areas.

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"The economic value added to a country hosting an international sports event has been said to benefit the community as a whole. However, many would argue that such events are a waste of useful resources, which could otherwise be streamlined to more needed areas. Although I am of the opinion that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in this essay I will discuss both viewpoints with the help of relevant examples.
To support my view, I would like to bring to attention the 2009 Olympics held in China, which brought individuals from all over the world. The funds collected from the event provided a massive boost to the economy of the country, a significant portion of which was utilised for the welfare of underprivileged children in the nation.
On the other hand, it is imperative to note that a majority of profits gained from these shows go to the upper classes. For example, the IPL tournaments held in India have seemingly benefitted the uber rich participating in the auctions, while simultaneously draining tax-payers of their money.
However, coming from a community where sports serves as a bonding activity, I would also like to elaborate on the non-economic benefits of these games. The Olympic Games, for instance, garner a mass crowd from various nations bringing a variety of individuals together. They act as a nidus for soothing political tensions and improve diplomatic relations in times of unrest.
While many may object to the violent nature of some sports such as boxing, and the impact they have on young minds, these activities also serve as a conversation starter and are likely to ignite a spark of interest for sports in many.

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"The economic value added to a country hosting an international sports event has been said to benefit the community as a whole. However, many would argue that such events are a waste of useful resources, which could otherwise be streamlined to more needed areas. Although I am of the opinion that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in this essay I will discuss both viewpoints with the help of relevant examples.
To support my view, I would like to bring to attention the 2009 Olympics held in China, which brought individuals from all over the world. The funds collected from the event provided a massive boost to the economy of the country, a significant portion of which was utilised for the welfare of underprivileged children in the nation.
On the other hand, it is imperative to note that a majority of profits gained from these shows go to the upper classes. For example, the IPL tournaments held in India have seemingly benefitted the uber rich participating in the auctions, while simultaneously draining tax-payers of their money.
However, coming from a community where sports serves as a bonding activity, I would also like to elaborate on the non-economic benefits of these games. The Olympic Games, for instance, garner a mass crowd from various nations bringing a variety of individuals together. They act as a nidus for soothing political tensions and improve diplomatic relations in times of unrest.
While many may object to the violent nature of some sports such as boxing, and the impact they have on young minds, these activities also serve as a conversation starter and are likely to ignite a spark of interest for sports in many.
In conclusion to the aforementioned points, I would like to state that while certain aspects of international sporting events must be checked upon, the pros are worth the effort of organising them.",,,,,,7.5,economic value added country hosting international sports event said benefit community whole however many would argue events waste useful resources could otherwise streamlined needed areas although opinion advantages outweigh disadvantages essay discuss viewpoints help relevant examples support view would like bring attention 2009 olympics held china brought individuals world funds collected event provided massive boost economy country significant portion utilised welfare underprivileged children nation hand imperative note majority profits gained shows go upper classes example ipl tournaments held india seemingly benefitted uber rich participating auctions simultaneously draining money however coming community sports serves bonding activity would also like elaborate benefits games olympic games instance garner mass crowd various nations bringing variety individuals together act nidus soothing political tensions improve diplomatic relations times unrest many may object violent nature sports boxing impact young minds activities also serve conversation starter likely ignite spark interest sports many conclusion aforementioned points would like state certain aspects international sporting events must checked upon pros worth effort organising

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"The topic indicates the international sports events could bring beneficial for a country. There are several aspects to approve as below:
Firstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.
Secondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities. For example, in order to hold the 2008 BeiJing Olympic Game China built the nation stadium , nation swimming center and Olympic community so on. Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China. Thirdly, an international sports event will efficiently encourage the citizens devoted more passions and enthusiasms to participate in it. For example, Bei Jing is the host city to held the 2022 Winter Olympic Game, which encourage a lot of Chinese to learn and participate these winter sports, like snowboard, skating. Fourth, there is an opportunity to perform various cultures and histories of country to all visitors.

Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion .
Firstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors .
The business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent .
On the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector . The example of DLF IPL scam by Lalit Modi supports the argument of such people , commonwealth scam is also one such.

Secondly, on the contract, as professional players, particularly some very famous athletes who have a lot of proponents and gain high reputations all over the world.

The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side.

I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.
Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.
Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.

Overall, it can be clearly seen that housing was the major expenditure in 1950 while in 2010 food became the most popular expense.
Turning to the first main feature, in 1950 72.1% of households spent on housing which was the highest ratio whereas there was an exact 22.0% of households in 2010. Additionally, the second largest proportion of expenditures in 1950 was food, amounting to 11.2%. The figure for food then increased to a precise 34.0% in 2010 which was the largest percentage. With respect to other expenses, this category accounted for only 4.4% in 1950 before rising to an exact 19.2% in 2010.
Turning to another main feature, there was an increase in the transportation expense from a mere 3.3% in 1950 to a modest 14.0% in 2010. In terms of health care, households spent on this category the least in both years, contributing to 2.4% and 4.5% in 1950 and 2010 respectively.

2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for people’s life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people’s competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.
It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people’s social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people’s communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people’s progress.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life.",,,,,,6.5,activities either group alone play crucial factor terms leading strong skills people life despite fact individual activities improve wide variety people competencies personally believe people would gain benefits participating team activities individually true group activities potentially strengthen people social skills argument favour team activities require participants collaborate team members result participants responsibility best also helping others bring best potential team achieve goal person everyone working together another common example group activities also foster people communication skills order get team aim succeed team members must deliver messages via conversation simple understandable way therefore people group activities likely expose experience time helping capable communicating effectively spite aforementioned advantages activities team fact individual activities also contributes many essential skills classic example development respect sports people sports alone running must strict running schedule order able run target distance another common criticism ability comparing others people activities alone set milestones reach target meaning truly understand actual potential interfered people progress conclusion undeniable individual activities possibly help people teach concentrate ability others nevertheless carefully contemplating outcomes types activities totally agree group activities result better teamwork communication skills important due fact competencies two important factors every people successful life

In terms of education for those two years, the percentage almost stays the same 6.3 and 6.6 respectively with a little difference between both of them.

First of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
In fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
In conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider.

1,The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.,"The pie charts illustrates how the movement of household has been expanding in a country in the period 1950 and 2010.
According to the pie chart in 1950 the housing works has taken the largest percentage among the other services. This is apparently refer to the need a lot of spending because the families were bigger than today. While the transportation and the others' cash is considered much the least between the whole needs.
In 2010, there is a big change in the whole life style which truly impact on families and their ways of spending money. First of all, buying food is quite important as original source for people energy, it has taken the largest amount in exactly 34%.And because many wives become worker, the need to buy ready meals become more necessary than before. Also, it is clear that transportation is almost nearly equal.
As to what has shown there is rapidly decreasing in housing's spending in 2010,and this is justified by the completely change of life in using less and simple thing instead of using expensive and too much staff, and also select smaller house rather than bigger ones. Moreover most families prefer to spend money on their pleasure and joyful life. It is noticed that other spending has jumped sharply from 4% to 19.2% which means people are turning to be consumers. Finally there is no doubt that education has less priority in both dates.

2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is no doubt that activities whether in group or individual considered as an important source for learning skills.These people claim that life skills can be developing and growing increasingly through team activities more than those which are done alone. This essay will argue why collaborating works against isolating ones are entirely necessary in gaining life abilities and competencies.
It is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.
Although some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.
This essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone.

1,The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.,"The pi charts illustrate the comparisons the average of household expenditures in 1950 and 2010 in a country. Overall, a considerable reduction in housing can be seen, while the expenditures in food remarkably soared in 2010.
Housing expenditures occupied nearly three-fourth, in 1950. In contrast, the expenditures plummeted to 22 percent in 2010. Alternatively, the expenditures for food tripled, compared with 1950 and 2010. Specifically, the percentage of food used to be 11.2 percent and drastically rose up to 34 percent.
In addition, there are some expenditures increased. For example, transport, and other. These percentages were 3.3 percent in transport, and 4.4 percent in other in 1950. But both percentages grow up to 14 percent and 19.2 percent in 2050 respectively. Interestingly, when it comes to expenditure in education, there is not a significant change. It was 6.6 percent in 1950 and it is 6.3 percent in 2010. Health care also slightly changed, the percentage of expenditure was 2.4 in 1950 and increased to 4.5 percent in 2010.

2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,
and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.
Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people are
the most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.
Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.
Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.",,,,,,7.0,topic group work beneficial peoples lives person tend work alone widely discussed across globe personally think good advantages team activities cause life especially business scenes comfortable productive initially one person work limited compared group activities means working one person able cause profits extent hand group working productive efficient make sales figures addition person great ability example people great communication skills negotiations people appropriate roles sales furthermore people good analysing group performance quality making strategies good activities best marketing team result focus strong points work divide conquer tasks course people eager work alone relaxed pace make profit extent less stressful need keep attention colleagues means need decide tasks take responsibility sometimes might risky made mistake caused huge deficit finally doubt two heads better one people share experiences opinion improve group activities people sensitive feel pressure people meddle much necessary organize rules must effective example people need try stay positive avoid stating negative swear words deny one person opinion straightforwardly emotionally making great atmosphere saying positive words including humor lead everyone performance productive

2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Group work is believed to foster more life skills than activities done solo. Although doing things alone is beneficial as it strengthens decision making skills, working in teams can educate more valuable life lessons as it teaches teamworking and negotiation skills necessary for living in a community.
Firstly, working in a group helps build teamworking skills. In a team, in order to be successful in doing peojects, members need to help one another in achieving mutual goals. Therefore, through these steps, team members will be trained on assisting others to reach the goal, although they may feel more competent undergoing a project on their own. Similarly, in real societies, people living in the same community cannot be careless to their neighbors and, instead, have to understand each other. Because of this understanding, they can tolerate one another.
Still, it can be argued that working collectively nurtures people to follow the crowd and hence, they cannot sharpen decision making skills. For this point, it is valid that a lone wolf has a clearer vision in its life direction than a pack of wolves that walk behind a leader. Still, a single leader may lead to a wrong path that ends up to a disaster for all other wolves. Thus, in order to make a right decision effectively, it is required that people work together since they can debate and negotiate what is appropriate for the team which, in turn, beneficial for each individual. Likewise, in a country, no single prime minister can dictate the country's direction. Nevertheless, opinions gathered from the parliament are necessary.
In conclusion, team projects are more useful in culminating skills crucial to live in a society. Teamworking skills gained from working together will lead to an understanding of other people not only in the team but in the same society. Moreover, people will be trained on negotiation and compromisation which yield better success than decisions done alone by a single person.",,,,,,7.0,group work believed foster life skills activities done solo although things alone beneficial strengthens decision making skills working teams educate valuable life lessons teaches teamworking negotiation skills necessary living community firstly working group helps build teamworking skills team order successful peojects members need help one another achieving mutual goals therefore steps team members trained assisting others reach goal although may feel competent undergoing project similarly real societies people living community careless neighbors instead understand understanding tolerate one another still argued working collectively nurtures people follow crowd hence sharpen decision making skills point valid lone wolf clearer vision life direction pack wolves walk behind leader still single leader may lead wrong path ends disaster wolves thus order make right decision effectively required people work together since debate negotiate appropriate team turn beneficial individual likewise country single prime minister dictate country direction nevertheless opinions gathered parliament necessary conclusion team projects useful culminating skills crucial live society teamworking skills gained working together lead understanding people team society moreover people trained negotiation compromisation yield better success decisions done alone single person

As is shown in the graph, a simple solar panel is a container whose top is a piece of transparent glass for absorbing sunshine. There are two channels on different sides of the contaniner which are inlet and outlet respectively.
There are two main uses for such panels, heating air or heating water. As for producing warm air, when air gets into the panel, sun rays crossing through the glass can raise the temperature of air up, turning to the warm air we need.
When it comes to water, the same principle is applied. The inner air is heated by the sun rays captured by the transparent glass. Then the heat is transported to the water passing through a tube inside the panel. After that, the solar panels manage to raise the water temperature up.",,,,,,6.5,diagram depicts solar panels structure work heat two different things shown graph simple solar panel container whose top piece transparent glass absorbing sunshine two channels different sides contaniner inlet outlet respectively two main uses panels heating air heating water producing warm air air gets panel sun rays crossing glass raise temperature air turning warm air need comes water principle applied inner air heated sun rays captured transparent glass heat transported water passing tube inside panel solar panels manage raise water temperature
2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.
Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.
It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.

2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic indicated that the family members no longer eat meals together in the modern society. The reason are complex and the phenomenon is inevitable.
I think the first factor is that the pressure from the modern age has increased. More and more family members busy on their jobs and studies. They undergo more pressures than ever have before. For example, a father who very busy at work, he usually work extra hours and social with his clients. His schedule is volatile thus he has to give up his time to eat meals with his family members. The second factor is that family members have their own schedules in the fast-moving world. Furthermore, the more social activities lead sophisticated to people's lifestyle. For example, a family member who goes to fitness center after work, he eat by individual instead eat meal together. The third factor is that the scale of family members has decreased, more and more family members left their hometown for the new place, like urban or big city. They cannot eat together due to geographical separation. Probably a family member eat meals by individual whom might feel lonely and insulated.
On conclusion, this social phenomenon is an evident of the changing society. Obviously, family member eat meal together that help them to reinforce their relationships each other and create a good communication among them. It would be a happiness moment when family members eating together.

Although more complex and modern solar panels are available in today’s world, a solar panel simply consists of three main parts, a box-shaped basement, transparent glass, the entry, the exit of the inner tube. Naturally, sunray as an energy source is essential to use the heating system.
Considering the function of solar panel, transparent glass which is in optimal thickness act as a receiver of heat from the sun, that eventually transfer to air or water.

2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that people less frequently gather around a table at meals with their family members, due to a number of factors such as changing trends in the living style and weakened relations between parents and children. I strongly believe that this has a devastating effect on the future of society.
Compared to half of a century ago, the habits of especially big-city dwellers have experienced a dramatic shift in recent years. While people get used to living in extended families, today they tend to live in smaller families called celullar families. In the following step, isolation became much more significant that children aged over 18 years prefer to move to a separate house. Additionally, even individuals who live with their family rarely share daily activities including eating meals, mainly related to different and busy working schedules. Apparently, the residents of the metropolis are reluctant to spend their time because of the increased incidence of depression or other psychologic disorders.
A growing body of evidence indicates that as people choose to do their activities alone, their family bonds are also negatively affected. As a physician, from my point of view, children who are raised in this environment are more likely to become antisocial and unsuccessful in both academic and social life. Furthermore, most of these young persons suffer from psychiatric disorders which are remarkably infrequent among people who keep in touch with their relatives. Also, these youngsters are more commonly committed crimes such as drug trafficking, robbery or, even murder.
In conclusion, quitting daily activities that are done together is the initial step of falling apart for family members which inevitably leads to worse outcomes for the society like increased risk of crime and psychiatric problems.",,,,,,6.5,people argue people less frequently gather around table meals family members due number factors changing trends living style weakened relations parents children strongly believe devastating effect future society compared half century ago habits especially dwellers experienced dramatic shift recent years people get used living extended families today tend live smaller families called celullar families following step isolation became much significant children aged 18 years prefer move separate house additionally even individuals live family rarely share daily activities including eating meals mainly related different busy working schedules apparently residents metropolis reluctant spend time increased incidence depression psychologic disorders growing body evidence indicates people choose activities alone family bonds also negatively affected physician point view children raised environment likely become antisocial unsuccessful academic social life furthermore young persons suffer psychiatric disorders remarkably infrequent among people keep touch relatives also youngsters commonly committed crimes drug trafficking robbery even murder conclusion quitting daily activities done together initial step falling apart family members inevitably leads worse outcomes society like increased risk crime psychiatric problems

2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, with all the technology and studies involved in sports, it is very important the amount of strength and muscle develop that athletes must have, as much as, the mental training, to confront hard moments and be able to overcome. There are people who believe that physical strength is the key for success, on the contrary, others think that mental strength is most important for being successful. While muscle and physical preparation are the main reason to overcome on weaker opponents. Mental strength, in my perspective, is the most important because provides something special and unbreakable that last longer and gives more than just muscle power.
One the one hand, it is the physical strength. Which provides more energy for developing and performing better in sports, such as soccer, tennis, golf with better and precises strikes on the ball. Although, gives an important advantage on weaker opponents in therms of power, mobility and speed among others, for instance, boxing against a 20 pounds lighter fighter. In global, physical strength is a good and simple reason to overcome weaker athletes.
On the other hand, it is the phychological factor or “the head”. Which deliver more reciliense and will to win in stress and critic situations, like the final match in the last set of a grand slam. Also, good mental state allows to compensate the strengh, muscle and energy of opponents by focalizing the attention on last longer, that is the case of runners in marathon and ultramarathons. In the end, menthal power deliver something special, not measurable and unbreakable that last longer than just physical power.

1,The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, countless measures have been implemented to reduce transmission amongst citizens. The use of hand sanitizers has been one of them, but what is it made of? Ethanol is a common disinfecting agent found in cleaning products, which originates from corn. Here's a nine-step manufacturing method of how this alcohol is produced from that supercrop.
In the first third of production, the maize is harvested, stored and ground up during milling. First, farmers collect ripened ears from fields, and then place them in bins and other containers. These are then crushed into a powder to increase the surface area, hence increasing the potential yield of ethanol created.
Steps four to six involve boiling, brewing and filtration. The powder produced in the milling process is mixed with water and boiling takes four hours. Once it is done, the mixtue is left to stand for 48 hours, allowing fermentation to occur, and unprocessed ethanol be created. After this two-day step, the mixture is filtered to separate the unpurified ethanol from the solid by-product.
Lastly, the liquid raw product is distilled, packaged in various containers and shipped to retailers. Filtration is carried out for five hours to increase the purity of the ethanol. Afterwards, the final product is packaged and stored until it is transported to stores, where we can purchase it for our daily use and protection.
Many important people such as farmers, scientist and transporters assist in the manufacturing process of ethanol and we thank them for creating this essential product.",,,,,,8.5,pandemic countless measures implemented reduce transmission amongst citizens use hand sanitizers one made ethanol common disinfecting agent found cleaning products originates corn manufacturing method alcohol produced supercrop first third production maize harvested stored ground milling first farmers collect ripened ears fields place bins containers crushed powder increase surface area hence increasing potential yield ethanol created steps four six involve boiling brewing filtration powder produced milling process mixed water boiling takes four hours done mixtue left stand 48 hours allowing fermentation occur unprocessed ethanol created step mixture filtered separate unpurified ethanol solid lastly liquid raw product distilled packaged various containers shipped retailers filtration carried five hours increase purity ethanol afterwards final product packaged stored transported stores purchase daily use protection many important people farmers scientist transporters assist manufacturing process ethanol thank creating essential product
2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Champions have been heralded across cultures and religions for centuries. Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?
For those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.
Others believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.
I believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history.",,,,,,8.5,champions heralded across cultures religions centuries hercules greek mythology samson bible known strength hermes messenger greek gods adorned winged sandals grant speed wind ancient current times champions shared skills via sports question arisen takes presedence brain brawn believe physical strength important success sport must consider effort put performing said activities running marathon easier said done raising 500kg head happen overnight rowing appealing synchronization without training athletes train gyms countless hours running treadmills strength training plyometrics develop power order effectively perform respective sports thus proving importance physical strength prevail sports others believe order distinguish average greats mental strength factor amount discipline perserverance psychological strengths allow athletes set world records former world strong man eddie hall stated used techniques psychologists unlock parts brain provide super strength similar people use life threatening situations lift cars save children able become first man deadlift 500kg though extreme sportsmen women must apply form mental strength push achieve excellence sports believe brain brawn harmoniously work together create exceptional champions sports physical strength baseline allows athletes perform skills endurance mental strength value needed push go one step ahead competition sportmen must able run lift even row without issue well try try try working limiting beliefs become apart sporting history

This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.
On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.
On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.
In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other.

The process of producing ethanol fuel starts with storing corn in large barns made out of plastic and wood. This is to prevent moisture from damaging it.
From these large barns, corn is taken to a milling plant where it is cooked for 4 hours. During the cooking process, water is maintained at a certain level to ensure that the corn is always submerged in water while boiling.
The cooked corn is then fermented for at least 48 hours. This is to prepare it for separation of solid by-products and the liquid drawn from the cooked and fermented corn.The solid by-product is dried to be used for other products like chuka, a cornflake-like snack eaten by children. However, the liquid is further purified into ethanol. The prosess of purifying the liquid into ethanol takes about 5 hours. Purified ethanol is stored in large containers and sealed for safety purposes.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. This essay will discuss both these views with examples and show that while some people esteem physical strength, it is important to think of mental stretgth as a companion of physical strength which give any person in sports agility and flexibility.
Physical strength has been supported by many people as an important factor for success in sport. Those who think that physical strength is more important believe that it is a person's physique that is required to win any sport. For instance, in a study conducted by the Australisn National Team among sport fanatics in Perth, 80% of participants stated that physical strength was everything that any person involved in any kind of sport required to be succesful. Some participants in this study cited soccer as one such sport requiring physical strength. These findings were supported by another study conducted by a PhD student at the University of Sydney. The student concluded that while mental strength was important in any physically inclined sport, it was difficult to measure brain resources recquired to engage in sports like running.
On the other hand, some people think that mental strength gives stamina and agility to any person involved in sports. One prominent argument in this school of thought is that the body is a slave of the mind. Every action taken by the body is a response to the triggers initiated in the mind. Therefore, nourishing and strengthening mental capacity translates to physical strength. In a research study conducted among college students in America, it was found that mental strength was more esteemed than physical strength. It was argued in this study that mental strength was the breath that gave life to physical strength.
In conclusion, it can be argued that the reality of both mental and physical strength and their role in supporting a succesful sports career is not painted in black and white. A physically strong person needs to use their mental strength to plan and outwit their opponent. They also need tact and flexibility of the body which stem from the coordination between the body and the mind.

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world. As the use of new techonology grows, people concern about what will be impact of this change. Some people argue the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among people, which will lead to negative impacts on the society. Whereas, Others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts. Which one is true? I will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay.
There is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction to some extent. People use social media to connect with other people. This kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction. However, using social media can not give the same feeling as a face-to-face interation. There is lack of intimacy and empathy. For this reason, it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media.
However, sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life. For example, friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias. This helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face-to-face interaction in the future. Moreover, some people even find out their lover through social medias.
In my opinion, the argument that the use of social media will replace face-to-face interaction is a little bit exaggerated. After all, most people use social media to assist their real life relationship, not to completely replace their face-to-face interactions with online chattings. The use of social media might replace some portion of face-to-face interaction, but in most cases, it will help us to connect with other people, and promote our real life interactions.",,,,,,6.0,use social media nowadays widespread around world use new techonology grows people concern impact change people argue use social media replacing interaction among people lead negative impacts society whereas others claim benefits use social media outweigh negative impacts one true compare two perspectives state opinion essay denying use social media replacing interaction extent people use social media connect people kind behaviors decrease aspiration real life interaction however using social media give feeling interation lack intimacy empathy reason easy fall lonelyness occupied social media however sometimes use social media assists interactions real life example friends far away interact social medias helps keep relationship lead interaction future moreover people even find lover social medias opinion argument use social media replace interaction little bit exaggerated people use social media assist real life relationship completely replace interactions online chattings use social media might replace portion interaction cases help us connect people promote real life interactions

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.
As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.
If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.
One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.
I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other.

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In recent years, technology has been coming a long way and result in large convenience in our society. Especially, social media is a great sample of our lifestyle that drastically changed, compared with a few decades ago. I believe the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages to some extent.
Initially, it is clear that peoples' communication tool immensely changed due to social media. For example, the name of social media, ""Club House"" allows people to communicate globally. This means that those who are interested in improving their language skill or other specific hobbies. Furthermore, people are able to have a consultation with people around the world about their conserns of their lifestyle and mental issues that used to be confidential to their family, or friends face-to-face. These advantages let people expand their insights. Moreover, in business scenes, people frequently tap into some other communication tools, like Skype, Microsoft teams, and Zoom meetings. This social media is much helpful to work regardless of time, and place so that people can work with other country's colleagues. This is more profitable to make a sales figure smoothly because they can make more strategies because of these tools.
On the other hand, there might be some disadvantages. For instance, some people warn that people tend to be deluded because of innumerable information on social media. This means that they face some fake news and fraud. In addition, people would like to spend with friends, family, and strangers in person as a human instinct. Therefore, it necessarily recoups their lonliness by taking advantage of social media because they unconsciously hope to spend a good time in person, more than in blind conversation.
Finally, there is no doubt that social media and advanced technology provide a lot of options than before. This innovation will allow us to communicate and exchange with a lot of people across the globe. It is inevitable to improve and people need to get along with them. As a result, our lifestyle will lead to more convenience.

The first thing to note is how consumption has surpassed by far the production levels, even though at first both started at a similar point.
On one side, consumption remained at a very low growth from 1982 until 1990, barely crossing the 2 million of oil barrels' threeshold. From that point on it skyrocketed, surpassing consumption in less than 4 years, although in 1994 the tendency slowed down. On the other hand, production experienced an increase from 1982 to 1986, but then leveled off at 3 million oil barrels. Since then there hasn't been any remarkable change, only a small positive trend starting in 1994 that hasn't stopped yet.

2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that individuals can't do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times. Personaly, I partially disagree with this statement and in this essay I will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion.
On one hand, I have to agree with this statement. Many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals. Whether it's pollution, deforestation or contamination, the indivual doesn't have as much impact as these entities have. Therefore, governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen. In addition, the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence. Only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter-balance this situation.
On the other hand, waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude. Individuals, while not having the same impact, can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem. Not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren't noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact. For example, recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do. If only one person does it, it won't have any effect, but it does when it's done by one million,
In conclusion, it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation.

Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.
To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.
Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982.

2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Individuals, who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited. Some people say it is almost nothing they can do. Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.
Initially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.
On the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.
Finally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control
the environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually.

Between 1982 till 2006, it is clear from the line graph that the oil number grow over the years with a significant escalation of oil barrels demands.
according to what is shown both production and consumption in 1982 are the same amounts with 2 million barrels per day. Firstly the production is moderately raised to 3 million in 1986. Then they remained in the same quantities till 1994. Then slowly grow to 3.5 million barrels till 2006. Secondly, meanwhile, consumption was stable from 1982 to 1990 with only 2 million barrels. However, the number increased almost double in the year 1994. consequently, since 1994 the relationship between the oil demands and supply began to change differently, due to a dramatic increase in oil consumption compared with production.
Overall, we could analyze that both production and consumption broke even in the year 1992. However, till the year 2006, the consumption of oil barrels has been doubled to more than 6 million barrels while the production remained the same as from the year 1998.",,,,,,7.0,line graph illustrates production consumption oil barrels china 1982 till 2006 clear line graph oil number grow years significant escalation oil barrels demands according shown production consumption 1982 amounts 2 million barrels per day firstly production moderately raised 3 million remained quantities till slowly grow million barrels till secondly meanwhile consumption stable 1982 1990 2 million barrels however number increased almost double year consequently since 1994 relationship oil demands supply began change differently due dramatic increase oil consumption compared production overall could analyze production consumption broke even year however till year 2006 consumption oil barrels doubled 6 million barrels production remained year 1998
2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.
In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.
Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.
Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.",,,,,,7.0,doubt days action individual powerful enough make environment better unless laws created government activities taken companies high impact strongly disagree idea ways help government individual essay prove point reasons examples nowadays people use social media platform power tell people around world behave therefore individual power convince others give higher attention environment create community specific goals improve example social media influencers could educate volunteer work youth make environment better instance show young people sort waste dangerous impact act way moreover individuals people start many actions benefit environment without obstructions hand government companies aware example companies use factories government must monitoring discharge fule conclusion carefully explaining points view opinion necessary wait government big companies act activity environment individuals create provide educational activities public preserve environment next generation

It is noticeable that several significant modifications were made over the period, which includes the new plan for lawn, access, and border, making the park more attractive for people with different purposes of visiting.
Looking at the information described above more closely, the brick wall around the park and the fence door as the entry at the bottom of the park in the year 1980 are no longer present nowadays. Instead of the sole entrance available for visitors in the past, there are four accesses located on each side of the square park now, combined through two walking paths with each other, which cross themselves in the middle of the park.
Talking about the change that occurred to the lawns inside the park, the green area was divided by the pavement into two parts in 1980, while due to the new layout of the walking part inside the park, the green area has been separated into four pieces with respective functions nowadays. The part with a small pond and a couple of sitting banks remains its initial usage for leisure, but its size has been slightly reduced. Furthermore, two new lawn parts have been created. While the one suited in the bottom right-hand corner is available for sports activities like football, the other one lying the opposite of it is applicable for picnics and barbecues with friends and family members.",,,,,,7.5,two given pictures compare layout square park year 1980 present day noticeable several significant modifications made period includes new plan lawn access border making park attractive people different purposes visiting looking information described closely brick wall around park fence door entry bottom park year 1980 longer present nowadays instead sole entrance available visitors past four accesses located side square park combined two walking paths cross middle park talking change occurred lawns inside park green area divided pavement two parts 1980 due new layout walking part inside park green area separated four pieces respective functions nowadays part small pond couple sitting banks remains initial usage leisure size slightly reduced furthermore two new lawn parts created one suited bottom corner available sports activities like football one lying opposite applicable picnics barbecues friends family members
2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction. While people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. In this essay, I try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
The first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. One of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. Since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. For instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. Another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. A prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. Although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
Despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. In my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. I believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. One measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
To sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all.",,,,,,8.0,doubt truth majority people want live society derive sense satisfaction people ceaselessly struggling improve society meet needs almost always problems issues remain keep society better essay try examine reason highly challenging even impossible task create ideal society give measures might helpful mitigate situation first step understand goal ideal society tough achieve one apparent reasons nearly possible give explicit definition ideality since desire person extremely different individual expectations excellent society look like immensely varied sometimes incompatible instance people wish society fewer foreign immigrants eventual rise crime intensive competitiveness job market others insist multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts merits future another obvious reason terms difficulty realizing requirements prime example eliminating discrimination gender sexual orientation although lot related laws introduced protect vulnerable population discriminated issue remains one significant concerns people need face every day despite complexity challenges creating ideal society everyone still large number things done enhance expectations people toward society live opinion ideal society includes least great tolerance believe education especially primary school kindergarten plays essential role teaching treat others respect benefits tolerant atmosphere society significantly one measure government leastwise take account fund meaningful projects school publicize advocate value fairness justice kindness sum although might possible create society satisfies whole population regarding huge diversity attitudes people hold toward key consideration ideal society still highly necessary make every effort make better one

In 1980, the rectangular park was walled on all four sides with two gates, one towards the west and one towards the south. An ‘L’ shaped road connected the two gates. A small pond was there between the road and the west wall of the park. There were benches on three sides of the pond. On each side of the road, towards the southeast and southwest were flower beds, with beautiful flowers. In the north east of the park, there was an area full of trees.
A lot of changes can be seen in the present view of the park. The boundary wall has been totally removed. The main road has been extended to the north and the east side. Amidst the trees, some picnic chairs and tables have been placed and people can also enjoy the barbecue over there.

Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because it’s unrealistic.
Striving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.
While it’s beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldn’t I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress can’t be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.
In conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality.

In this essay, I will give my point of view of an ideal society and after I will explain the methods to create this society.
To begin with, from my experience and perspective, I believe that the ideal society is a place without criminals and serious offenders. A community without crime is a wonderful and safe place for our children and our families to live in harmony without rapes, thefts and murders. For example, in an isolated village outside a theme park in Canada, the locals lived with rules and culture without violence and crimes and everybody was happy and satisfied with their jobs and social life. Furthermore, the local community was very well balanced without arguments and conflicts because of the lack of serious offenders and criminals.
On the other hand, the creation of an ideal society is something very difficult. I honestly believe that the only way to build a balanced community is to educate our children because they are the future of this world and they need good examples and knowledge to create a good character. For instance in Ancient Athens, Greece local politicians and philosophers were responsible to educate the young people not only in school but also in the street or open theatres. As a result of this action, young people received knowledge and fundamentals to be ideal citizens of ancients Athens.
To conclude, from my point of view there is no place for crimes and offences in an ideal society because these will destroy the balance and the harmony of the people.

2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school, has been discussed across the world, including in Japan. Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school.
For example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school. For example, learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically. And learning English will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide. In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds.
Finally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future. This means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school, it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations.

What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.
On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.
On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.
To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.",,,,,,7.0,education programs different one area another area systems learners required choose restricted number courses academic curriculum age educational systems ask students take comprehensive courses graduate school many positives trends opinion limited range academic subjects education system better one hand basic knowledge accept idea pupils study selected number subjects age fifteen informative academically specified field study example student decide take medical subjects early age student prepared tutors completely nominated curriculum result student focus medical topics thus student qualified practice medicine efficiently school system build solid knowledge background limited range subjects help develop creativity early financial view point may better students enroll limited range subjects age 15 selected number academic subjects means less money allocated educational services guardians hand true claim general subjects system prepare students informative various different live aspects since students register wide range subjects system gain academic knowledge support fields mathematics physics medicine ect therefore students select one speciality practice professionalism wide range system help improve social interactions better friends separated continue school education together graduation inaddition chance make friends primises crowded sum educational systems main target develop progress academic background opinion better enroll limited range subjects age 15 due reasons like solid academic background specific field creativity less financial burden parents

2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The is a common belief that students’ focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results. However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.
On the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals. For instance, in China, over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field. Students can apply to those schools when they turn 15. According to a statistic from one of the business schools, 70% of their students received high scores in the national exam.
Nevertheless, a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence. Students can student various knowledge from different aspects, they can choose the subject they are interested in most. Moreover, students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university. Numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself. Students are motivated to do their best. For example, over 90% of students at the Norway University claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university. They have a full idea of what they like and dislike. They found that school life is excited and full of happiness.
To sum up, it is apparent that students can be well-developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices, however, it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests.",,,,,,6.5,common belief students focus selected subjects secondary school beneficial school results however persuasive argument students studying wide range subjects throughout school life applicable future one hand studying limited range subjects 15 years ago helps students develop specific abilities decide stream subjects art science commerce focused special training teaching method help become specialist professionals instance china 500 business schools opened train students become specialists business field students apply schools turn according statistic one business schools 70 students received high scores national exam nevertheless wide range subjects suitable students develop intelligence students student various knowledge different aspects choose subject interested moreover students longer time study choosing faculty university numbers basic knowledge longer time consider helping make best decision themself students motivated best example 90 students norway university claimed satisfied studying subjects choosing university full idea like dislike found school life excited full happiness sum apparent students specific subject limited range choices however undeniable wide range subject develop real interests

2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Nowadays, due to a wide range of education methods and systems, there are a lot of opinion and debates for which being the best orientation for students. Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.
First of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.
Conversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.
In summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part.",,,,,,5.0,nowadays due wide range education methods systems lot opinion debates best orientation students experts believe good pupil focus subjects school life however criticisms argue subject students practical knowledge require education systems might different benefits students well prefer latter rather former first may evidence people reckon upsides concentration mainly subjects considering fact learning many subjects may feel confused well overwhelmed gain lot knowledge time given circumstance students studying hong kong must take dse every year age fifteen hong kong examination assessment authority recommends students choose seven subjects exam result practices well revisions much hence students would like test could suitable study primary subjects conversely criticisms considered probably good students pick variety subjects view finding interests avoiding spoon feed information since many educators think hong kong education system way could harm students mental physical health instance parents hong kong complain education curriculums concentrated spoon feed information rather giving life experience students parents sometimes enjoy choose various study tours well extra curriculums children thus people tend immersing experience studying subjects young age summarize hard say opinion would best since different types education methods may advantages disadvantages hand personally key pupils never know done tried reason prefer studying vary subjects young age expert major part

2,The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.
With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?
There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.
Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.
In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.",,,,,,8.0,many years traditional teaching learning l approach teacher disseminating knowledge group students classroom dominent world advancement information communication technology new learning approaches proposed adopted example students use computers surf internet find information knowledge would like study moreover number education contents available online provide learners expected tradition l approach exist would true doube increasing number l approaches due emergence new technologies together new approaches see shift role teachers years one responsible disseminate knowledge also faciliator learning teachers provide proper directions students study current technology able offer people say artificial technology threat still accuracy providing suggestions students high moreover human teachers able provide emotional support students studying robotic process human beings students may encounter difficulties learning process feel frustrated eventually affect progression study human teachers could aware situation numeric assessment results emotional behaviour students classroom provide prompt proper counselling support advice students also still computers even ai weak creating new knowledge university setting teaching conventional knowledge professors would disseminate new research findings students class discussion among students inspiring unexplored areas l process effective happens classroom setting conclusion technology may alter way teach learn spite human teachers also adaptive certain roles teachers replaced tools machines therefore believe tradition classroom l setting replaced completedly future

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings. It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout.
Although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown.
Nowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices.
To conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint.",,,,,,6.5,councils debating building housing areas expanded land better solution providing taller dwellings might extremely complicated choice considering skyrocketing rise number people world change prefering city essay explore optimal solutions cities layout although ideal solution might depend cities aiming generic point view would optimal dwellings compacted dimished size land first justification cramping everything reduced area growing tall allowes residents reach shops workplaces dwindling time walking public transport vehicles moreover taking account overall incresing population density creation taller layout sustainable market demand shown nowadays antiquated method construct residences wider area land feasible locations cities running vacant lands fact many single houses occupying vast areas luxury amenities limited family building erected accomodating many households furthermore implementation infrustracture roads parking needed individuals able arrive destination without private car due long distances cover highway required therefore lands taken away agglomerate dwellings business offices conclude world shifting toward highly populated areas councils need keep date convinient cities layout like skyscrapers rather single houses ease people lifestyles reduced citizens footprint

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.
Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.
In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.",,,,,,5.5,big cities especially tokyo osaka yokohama japan tend build taller buildings like skyscrapers local cities places scarcely populated built wider quite understandable terms space might solutions dissipate populations around japan initially main reason people tend gather big cities many opportunities get job famous headquarter companies branches based foreign countries therefore people move big cities many taller apartments buildings built let live limited space seems stressful due people densely populated infrastructures well organized especially transport medical care security contrast population countryside becomes less therefore plenty space build houses wider area seems comfortable live lifestyle apparently difficult obtain new job lacking transport need rely cars addition number hospitals much smaller big cities issues long controversial first world problem finally spread worldwide many people started work home lap top computer innumerable companies adopted systems able work remotely addition companies already stated systemized working style change however completely ended means many people necessarily need live big cities therefore transport system well organized especially establishing improving train works faster frequently effort helpful dissipate population outside big cities also promotive tackling great infrastructures countrysides conclusion result densely populated cities able reduce population increase population countryside result issues resolved become solutions finally might able build wider houses big cities reasonable prices

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"In my opinion, the two solutions both have its pros and cons. But I think the first solution which is, create housing areas by providing taller buildings, is a better solution. Providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment. Also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways. So does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking. On the other hand, if we choose to build houses on a wider area, the land will still, be eventually out of use. And they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country. Also, houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site. Although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes, but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt. In conclusion, I think create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution because it solves the fundamental problem which is not having enough places for people to live by not using new lands and can also creates less harm for the nature, which is significantly important.",,,,,,5.5,opinion two solutions pros cons think first solution create housing areas providing taller buildings better solution providing taller buildings save area lands use create areas green grass trees help environment also taller buildings provide greater view designed creative ways buildings cities create skyline makes city scenario modern breathtaking hand choose build houses wider area land still eventually use likely destroy wildlife nature areas since places wide areas mostly rural parts country also houses wide spread large area crowded seem messy ideal site although maybe people think shorter buildings safer fire natural disasters like earthquake comes number times problems occur low modern technology also help lower risk people getting hurt conclusion think create housing areas providing taller buildings better solution solves fundamental problem enough places people live using new lands also creates less harm nature significantly important

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"In the modern society,it is seen that the buildings in the housing areas vary from one city to the other city where some cities prefer taller buildings and other cities prefer smaller buildings on a wide land.
This essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building.
It is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities.The main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities.As a solution for this problem,people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them.However,this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation.For instance,in Mumbai,the largest city in India,the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem.
In contrast,some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land.This enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style.For example,in Chandigarh,a union territory in India,the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like Mumbai.
To summarise,some cities with high cost of land and the high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation and leading to overcrowding where as the in the cities with the opposite situation ,the houses are built on a larger piece of land providing adequate space between each house.",,,,,,8.5,modern society seen buildings housing areas vary one city city cities prefer taller buildings cities prefer smaller buildings wide land essay illustrates reason built way compares advantages disadvantages type building often said taller buildings ideal houses metropolitan main reasons cost land large population big solution problem people big cities prefer taller buildings homes easily affordable leads crowding lack adequate instance mumbai largest city india cost land population high majority constuction companies build taller buildings order solve problem contrast cities lower population comparatively lower cost land build shorter buildings wide enables cities prevent crowding communities wider open area greenery providing lot ventilation helping people lead better life example chandigarh union territory india construction houses perfectly executed providing enough space house cost land population relatively low compared cities like mumbai summarise cities high cost land high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation leading overcrowding cities opposite situation houses built larger piece land providing adequate space house

2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.
First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.
Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.
But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.
In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.",,,,,,5.5,strongly agree statement women men working full time share household works first women men working full time working amount time logically amount time household works sam however one work longer hours household works still shared one household works second everyone responsibility household works everyone lives house makes house dirty creates dirty clothes dishes either women men household works fair work full time mentioned amount time household works arranged evenly shared instance woman family work longer hours got extra call work man help part household works man working woman solve problem household works also show women men supporting various situations conclusion women men full time jobs share household works split two halves alternatives depending working hours special situations way house peaceful harmony without arguments household works

The process starts after the rain drops slip at the roof of the houses and then enter the pipes which is connected to the under ground system for water treatment. As these drops flow in the drain, they directly move towards the water filter. After the filtering process ends, water is then passed to a storage where it can be stored and then transfered to the next procedure. When the water slides from the storage and moves to the water treatment tank, a small device at the top of the tank produces chemicals in order to clear the water from any additional wastes or bacteria that the water filter was not able to clear before. Finally, the loop ends when the water is treated and moves back to the pipes which is the connection between the water treatment system and the houses. People can now have a drinkable water in different sections in their homes.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time. In my opinion, it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons.
In many developing countries, people are required to work more than before; as a result, both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them. If the chores are being handled by both men and women, it increases the other partner's satisfaction and shows responsibilty. For instance, if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school, this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification.
Secondly, as technology evolves, people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home. As a result, children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents. Although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time, giving priority to one before the other can be counter-productive. Finally, as both partners work together to handle household work, it will eventually lead to a balanced life, their daily schedules will be organised; moreover, they will have more time to spend with their children thus, the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home.

Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,"The diagram illustrates the process of drinking water production from rainwater in a town in Australia.
Overall, there are five steps involved in producing drinking water for domestic purposes, starting with rainwater collection and ending with drinking water being ready for consumption.
First, rainwater is collected in a tank, which is attached next to houses. This collected water then passes through a drain down to the water filter under the ground where it is purified. Afterwards, such cleaned water travels passing to a large storage tank set up at the lower level before being sent to a water treatment station. At this point, such cleaned water is treated by some chemicals added from the top of the container. Once it has been processed, drinking water passes along a pipe back to the aboveground level where it is then consumed by households.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In many parts of the world, both men and women are full-time employees, which has led to the trend of shared household chores for both genders. In my opinion, this shift should be encouraged to reduce inequality issues while it also benefits family relationship.
First, sharing housework is reasonable because it will enhance gender equality, which is a worrying problem in many societies. In the past, it was widely believed that women were solely responsible for household works since women have the distinctive characteristics of care and neatness. This has resulted in many women in many countries, particularly in Asia, under pressure and engendering a sense of resentment regarding overwhelming housework. If such jobs are shared to men, it is highly that such burdens are minimised, thus being treated more fairly.
Another compelling reason for having both males and females engaging in doing household chores is the reduction in a family dispute. If such duties are mainly done by only men or women, the other tends to feel overwhelmed, which might, in turn, lead to domestic argument and violence. A clear explanation is a higher rate of divorce in America, which is caused by the unnecessary argument made by young adult couples.

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"Striving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. In some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. This essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and I reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.
There are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. Firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. The management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. For instance, employees in Japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. This forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.
Secondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. It causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. For example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. If the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.
As per the reasons stated, I absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. It is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. Inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company. Work-life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human.",,,,,,7.5,striving career development people lifetime target modern city nations employees spend long time work becomes phenomenon essay going yo discuss reasons behind reckon negative development companies employees two main reasons behind phenomenon firstly could corporate culture company management members company may agree workers spending long period time office equals excellent performance instance employees japanese company could get greater annual bonus better chance promote eager work long hours forces employees show office giving good impression boss secondly competition different companies market nervous coporate sectors willing push colleagues enhance sales performance causes great pressure employees need work long hours fuifill expectation managements example product sales agents performance depends sales number quarterly agent sale products effectively receive less revenues even sacked per reasons stated absolutely think negative development employees companies gives unnecessary pressure colleagues affect mental health inversely downgrades performance employee well company balance important everyone suitable relaxing time considerably enhance performance human

Turning to the first main feature, home owner was the most popular housing in 1991 and 2007, accounting for 60% and 70% respectively. The second most popular housing was social renting. In 1991 social renting contributed to an exact 23% which then decreased noticeably by 6% to a precise 17% in 2007.
Turning to another main feature, social housing. Was the least popular housing over the survey period. The proportion of social housing was a modest 6% in 1991.

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.
It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.
With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.",,,,,,7.0,nowadays many businesses compete order survive rapidly changing world leading high amount time employees spend working also reasons employees work long period discuss essay terms consequences personally believe spending time work negative development fact people various rationales work long hours classic example dynamic working condition many companies provide services consultation customers meaning service completely satisfy clients need client may decide use service competitors hence employees required dedicate time deliver best service clients another common criticism bright career path employees work long period carefully check works result delivery works less mistakes way could impress manager likely get promotion return careful consideration regarding consequence working long hours many vital drawbacks obvious effect increase illness people work hard spend lot time work therefore may enough time exercises weakening immune system body furthermore rise amount working hours people tend lack social skills may able manage time join social events meet friends resulting less ability adapt new environments conclusion undeniable people work long hours requirement business personal career goal opinion leads negative development behavior negatively affects health condition social competency two important aspects life

These percentages were much higher than the second highest percentage, social renting. The social renting was close to a quarter in 1991. And it can be seen a slight reduction in 2007. It is specifically 17 percent due to the increase of homeowners.
Another interesting point is private renting. The percentage remained the same in 1991 and 2007. It is 11 percent.

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In some countries, including Japan, people tend to spend long hours at work. In recent years, this issue is often discussed around Japan. Although some Japanese people take it positively, I strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now. I would like to state some reasons with some examples in Japanese society.
Firstly, the Japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two. Many buildings and companies were devastated, therefore, Japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy. As a result, the Japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed. As a result, the Japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980. In these periods from 1950 to 1990, the longer people work, the more money returned to employees. In addition, it was traditionally believed for Japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in Japanese society.
But the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992, Japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022. Sadly, working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit. Although it is because of economic recession, companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company's profit. As a result, some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression. Currently, Japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries.
Finally, in my opinion, the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create. For example, many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees. Therefore, they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in IT, language, and accountant. If each employee upskilled their ability, it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently. In addition, it must be more effective to adopt intern-ship work opportunities for university students. This means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time.
In conclusion, Japanese society is suffering from depopulation, too. This means that Japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce. Therefore, companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee. I believe Japanese people will be able to resolve this problem, because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history.",,,,,,6.5,countries including japan people tend spend long hours work recent years issue often discussed around japan although japanese people take positively strongly oppose idea believe longer positive development would like state reasons examples japanese society firstly japanese economy used worst poverty country around world world war two many buildings companies devastated therefore japanese people stucked together recover damage improve economy result japanese economy drastically steadily developed result japanese economy wealthiest country periods 1950 1990 longer people work money returned employees addition traditionally believed japanese people virtue work long hours japanese society economic bubble suddenly exploded 1992 japanese economy suddenly declined economic growth still remains sadly working long hours necessarily connected companies profit although economic recession companies still believed important work hours result increase company profit result people became workaholics number people suffering mental depression currently japan one highest suicide rates developed countries finally opinion important point productive systems companies organizations need create example many companies tend rely much tasks employees better skills positions employees therefore need provide curriculums specific skills language accountant employee upskilled ability would able divide conquer tasks efficiently addition must effective adopt work opportunities university students means already work experience beforehand cause reduce training time conclusion japanese society suffering depopulation means japanese people required work less volume workforce therefore companies government need consider work efficiently reduce much tasks one employee believe japanese people able resolve problem diligent made many success make countermeasure long history

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"It is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it. This essay will argue this statement, provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples.
There are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs, beyond the work hours stated in the contracts. One reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three-month probation period. Another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once, hence they get stressed out as they're restricted with the deadlines. On the other hand, some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self-development, e.g. studying for some certification programs, online master degree, etc.
When it comes to the consequences, it can be either positive or negative, depending on the reason itself. If it is self-development then it is a good thing.

In 1991, there were a 22 million total number of homes reported and rocketed to 27 million in 2007. When it comes to homeownership, it depicts that there was a 60% of total number of housing, then it suddenly rose by 10% after 16 years. There were two types of renting, the first one is social renting which consisted of 23% in 1991 before it plummeted in 2007 down to 17%.

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In recent times as technology progresses, majority of people have spent longer time at work for many reasons which can be caused by a high work demands and people need to cope with their daily living. This development would have negative connotations, if people would not have a work-life balance and gradually affect their health.
Numerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer. Firstly, there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements. As an individual worker, sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks. In most shipping companies or factories in the Philippines, for instance, there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime. Secondly, nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills. In Canada, the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some, so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more.
Spending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks, an absence or lack of work-life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run. For married people, family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond. Workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter. According to one research in the US, found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress- related diseases such as depression, heart disease and chronic back pain.
To conclude, most people have spent longer time working due to extreme work demands and personal financial challenges. Although this gives some benefits to oneself or companies, it can turn one's life into unhappy and unhealthy life.",,,,,,7.0,recent times technology progresses majority people spent longer time work many reasons caused high work demands people need cope daily living development would negative connotations people would balance gradually affect health numerous workers sometimes oblige stay work longer firstly huge companies need workforce time keep work requirements individual worker sometimes requires extend work hours finish workload assigned tasks shipping companies factories philippines instance often outrageous number workload done therefore multitude employees tied work forced render overtime secondly nowadays people facing large debts bills canada cost living quite high unaffordable several people work double jobs often overtime earn extra spending much hours working two possible drawbacks absence lack balance acquiring diseases long run married people family time significantly valuable order maintain good family bond workaholic people tendency negelct importance family bonding tend experience health problems thereafter according one research us found number workaholic people tripled 10 million 30 million decade majority people suffered related diseases depression heart disease chronic back pain conclude people spent longer time working due extreme work demands personal financial challenges although gives benefits oneself companies turn one life unhappy unhealthy life

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.
Initially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.
People do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.
On the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.
Finally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent.",,,,,,7.0,people strongly argue money shared ways contrast necessary invest money developing technology space exploration although benefits spend money space exploration believe money spent disparity wealth environment initially developing technology space exploration necessary extent example people found drastically innovative resource another planet takes place current resources specifically fossil fuel wood people need take care limited resources earth addition improving technology cause people convenience earth result example recently scientists planning launch space rocket transport system earth hat takes two hours new york shanghai rocket hand lot problems earth especially developing countries people suffering poverty developed countries waste massive food addition even developed countries disparity wealth widening therefore money spent space exploration used people lives safely around world developed countries must many options give hand developing countries example must effective provide infrastructure agriculture sharing clothing food dispose developed countries finally including opinion people choose nationality means people born developing country need suffered poverty definitely unfair therefore money spent space exploration partially spend developing countries result disparity wealth wider people able live quality lifestyle developed countries extent

However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.
On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
On the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.

Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.
Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.
Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.
In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue.

However, there are many other pre-existing problems on the other side of this planet that require attention and aids, such as hunger and proverty. In this case, I think these issues should be prioritized because every human life is precious. If those people's lives are taken care off, there should be less worries on scientific research as well.

To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some governments budget a considerable amount of expenditure on space exaploration, yet many opponents voice their opinion that it is meaningless to financially support this aspect, and this money should be alternatively allotted on other more important priorities. My firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long-term benefits.
From a short-term pespective, there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget. The result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable. If research fails, it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost. Besides, compared with space exploration, education inequality, health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues, meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people's quality of life.
However, I firmly believe we should hold a long-term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space. First of all, environmental problems, such as global warming and water shortage, are gradually worsening and threatening people's health to a large extent. Allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet, which might provide a soultion to those long-exisiting environmental issues. Also, many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind, such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation, are also highly reliant on the space technology.

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"For years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.
Planet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.
Space exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.
Since the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.

First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers.

2,Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.
Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.
Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.
Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.",,,,,,7.0,nowadays people waste lot food bought shops restaurants essay reason wasting food acts done humans reduce amount food one throws away thorougly discussed firstly people waste food one tends satisfied amount one eats thus people order food one eat one estimate amount food amount food one person consume differs one conditions moment conditions include mood physical features activities one particular day furthermore one wants taste sorts food however one eat sometimes people order food well decorated take photo upload social media instagram taking photo people leave food mentioned reasons causes wastage food apparently people reduce amount food throw away restaurants provide informations amount taste briefly avoid situation consumers finish food dissatisfied taste smell moreover consumers make wise decision waste food money people reduce wastage food causes pollution land leads bad smell brings insects areas conclusively quite clear people greatly waste food ways people follow reduce amount waste food

Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.
Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.

2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with.
It is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid.
In spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term.
In conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run.",,,,,,7.0,undeniable crime inevitably contributes negative consequences society affects various aspects hence belief giving longer prison sentences could effective way reduce crime rate nevertheless also opponents believe effective mitigations also available personally agree true sentenced long period people want experience criticism favor live prison lack freedom prisoners forced stay jail meaning could meet companions well traveling another country end prison term another common example supports idea increasing sentence term prisoners control authorities time living condition would possibly result loss privacy experience people tend avoid spite fact giving longer sentences seems effective solutions could also applied classic example people break laws must pay extremely high penalty governments since people want lose money policy likely encourage people follow laws leading declining number crime another potential solution could done schools teach young generations effects crime students understand committing crime would lead lower standard living people communities reducing neighbors safety tend behave opposite way improve living conditions people instead would hugely positive impacts long term conclusion despite fact prison long time completely terrible experience people flexibility privacy life seems alternatives paying higher fines educating young people respect negative effects crime tend effective solutions likely address root cause committing crime tend applicable long run

Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"The topic of whether giving longer prison sentences lead to a decrease in the rate of crime or some other alternative solutions might be helpful to reduce the rate of crime. Although it depends on each country's crime rate and cost, I believe some alternative solutions will be realistic for reducing crime.
First of all, some people believe giving a long sentence will be not only a safe solution, but also useful to pay an attention to other people not to commit a crime. They state that this is the best way in terms of cost, and the organization well systemized. They believe the crime rate will go down as a result.
On the other hand, some people oppose the system. The longer prison sentences have an influence to some extent. But for the victims and their families can not be convinced, and if alternative systems are well organized, some crimes might be prevented in advance. Therefore, it must be necessary to deploy the military or police in a specific area where crimes often occur. This is effective to inhibit the crime rate.
Finally, crimes, criminals often sporadically emerge, even if the government stipulates the law which serves long prison sentences. This is ubiquitous around the world. Therefore, the most important point is how people need to become aware of dangerous situations and avoid not being involved. In addition, governments need to delegate stronger authority to the police and military to patrol around the specific area twenty-four seven, as comparatively higher crimes occur in the town. This might be costly, but it is worthwhile to configure a safe society.",,,,,,6.0,topic whether giving longer prison sentences lead decrease rate crime alternative solutions might helpful reduce rate crime although depends country crime rate cost believe alternative solutions realistic reducing crime first people believe giving long sentence safe solution also useful pay attention people commit crime state best way terms cost organization well systemized believe crime rate go result hand people oppose system longer prison sentences influence extent victims families convinced alternative systems well organized crimes might prevented advance therefore must necessary deploy military police specific area crimes often occur effective inhibit crime rate finally crimes criminals often sporadically emerge even government stipulates law serves long prison sentences ubiquitous around world therefore important point people need become aware dangerous situations avoid involved addition governments need delegate stronger authority police military patrol around specific area seven comparatively higher crimes occur town might costly worthwhile configure safe society

I believe, that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence.
Firstly, by keeping people encarcelated for years, 'the problem is locked up' and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served. For instance, for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder, a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal's possible danger for the society. On the contrary, for little criminals, like robbery, mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option.
On the other hand, by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime, could be a clever step. For example, in Switzerland, social workers work very hard to get, mostly youngster, an apprenticeship. So, they are kept busy and usually happy. By placing people to jail for a long time, they loose the contact to the outside world. Therefore, trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime, would be a reasonable. In other words, these citizens could wear electronically sensors, so that the judicial services can check on them. That would be a win-win situation for the government, society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his/her life.

1,The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.,"Nowadays, human activities are the main reason that cause problematic events or natural disaster around the World. One of the most noticable causation is the deforestration. The negative impact from cutting the forests can result in many horrible events. In this essay, we will take a look at how can the deforestration can cause many of the negative impact and disasters. Starting from clear cutting of forests and result in flooding and less biodiversity.
For the flooding, the initial cause of the problem is when human eradicates the forest, we usually used heavy equipment to invade the forest. With all the equipments standing and pressurizing the soil. the soil becomes hard and baked, which makes the rain water to runs off and causing the flooding disaster.
Furthemore for the less biodiversity impact, the woods cutting can affects the bioecosystem from three main reasons. First is when there is a deforestration project, lower amount of trees and roots to hold the top soil. which caused them to erodes. Second, the risk of burning from the invading destroyed the waste wood from logging and decrease the amount of foods for micro-organisms. Lastly lower amount of plants means less moisture returned to the air. in which increased the rate of drought to happened. From these three main causes, it resulted in the pioneer species move in and vegetation is degraded and further caused a less biodiversity in the forest.
According to these informations the deforestration caused flooding events and less biodiversity in the forest from the artificial equipments that can cause the negative impact to soils and increase the chance of flooding.

2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.
First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.
For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago.

1,The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.,"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.
According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.
If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.
The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.
The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.
To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.",,,,,,7.5,supplied illustration outlines problems cutting forests see 4 main branches describes certain issue caused deforestation according first branch left forest destruction lead state soil becomes hard baked occurs due fact heavy logging equipment compresses soil first block chart says soil becomes baked rain water starts run causes flooding look remaining branches see lead conclusion less biodiversity three different reasons first one soil erosion cut trees fewer tree roots support topsoil eventually erodes second reason increased risk burning followed destruction waste wood pioneer species move initiate degradation vegetation resulted less biodiversity last branch starts fact cutting forests less plants give back moisture air less moisture enters air triggers less precipitation increased droughts plants unable withstand hot dry weather die ends less biodiversity conclude everything main purpose presented flow chart demonstrate severe damage could caused deforestation
2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.
First, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.
The second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.
If we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.
To conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit.",,,,,,7.5,new technologies come new ways communicate people first emails social media variety different apps give us opportunity chat one another kind online communication entered personal also professional life topic rather controversial people different opinions essay gon na talking pros cons new type working communication first would like start advantages online communication work opinion main thing makes people go meeting face face talk online fact convenient set specific date meet someone also talk someone wherever want without needing drive office two things need cellphone computer internet connection think nowadays wo problem anyone majority people stuff second advantage functionality apps online communication let take zoom think almost everyone used app 2020 lockdowns world including arrange meeting thousands people using app much easier gathering large amounts people one place also record meeting wish send recording people absent use future remember details face face meetings provide us opportunities talk disadvantages see lot thing miss online communication ability see human emotions facial expressions find really important especially comes discussing important projects deals experience say lockdown country due pandemic missed physical interaction colleagues handshaking etc find physical interaction effective way team building might hard work without using online communication conclude would say everyone different opinions whether better meet online face face sure get rid face face meetings completely otherwise hard keep team

First of all, the deforestation is horrible thing for soils, its richness and fertility. Because of forests cutting soil becomes harder and it looses its ability to absorb the water. As a result we could face the flooding after strong rains. In addition soil starts to erod and we can see the vegetation degradation in this area as a result.
Secondly the most important consequence of deforestation is biodiversity decreasing. The land without enough quantity of trees can face drought and fires. The vegatation will be degraded in a couple of years and a lot of species won't have an ability to stay there and find nutrition.
As a conclusion, it's possible to say that we always need to evaluate all of the consequances of forest cutting before doing it. Probably the total cost would be so high that it would be cheaper to keep forets safe.",,,,,,5.5,scheme observing whole diversity forests cutting consequences threat flooding biodiversity decreasing first deforestation horrible thing soils richness fertility forests cutting soil becomes harder looses ability absorb water result could face flooding strong rains addition soil starts erod see vegetation degradation area result secondly important consequence deforestation biodiversity decreasing land without enough quantity trees face drought fires vegatation degraded couple years lot species wo ability stay find nutrition conclusion possible say always need evaluate consequances forest cutting probably total cost would high would cheaper keep forets safe

We stiil sit at home rather then go to a restorant with friends and a lot of companies still keep their offices locked.
On the one hand office workers from all over the world opened the possibility of working from home. This option gives you more freedom and diversity of places from wich you can do your job: you can meet with your collegues from cafe or library, from kitchen or bedroom. Also, we were forced to keep our social nets with online tools, to communicate with our friends and families. Now we all learned to use such programmes like Zoom or Skype to speak with each other. Probably if we hadn't the Covid, we would struggle bigger difficulties when someone from our buddies would come to another country or town, but now we all know what to do with this, how to keep in touch. We also got to appreciate the power of touching more then before, because we were missing it for these long monthes. How it was nice to hug an old friend after long quarantine!
On the other hand we really weaned from normal offline communication. And we can't evaluate how many people started to think that online is absolute substitute of offline. It's obviosly not like that. During online meeting it's impossible to have a normal common discussion because it needs to have only one person speaking. Also people lack of possibility to see each others eyes, so they don't feel enough contact with each other.
As a conclusion it is possible to say that situation with increasing popularuty of online meetings is ambivalent. This type of communication save our connections with each other during the pandemia, but there is a risk of substitution real meetings by online in the situations when it is not appropriate.

2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Education is one of the most important topics for childhood development, and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination. Some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject, and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents.
Indeed, music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience. Learning music instruments requires patience, creativity and good discipline. Inherently, in order to master a music instrument, a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best, for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice. The heart of a musician, the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career, not only the career in music.
However, despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments, childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes ""mandatory"", which, of ocurse, includes music instruments. It might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years, but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician. Making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies. Moreover, making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child. Just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework. It does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience.
In conclusion, it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years, but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music, educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies.",,,,,,7.5,education one important topics childhood development music beneficial children helps sustain creative thinking improve imagination educators demand music taught mandatory subject yet others think forcing children play music instruments limit chances discover develop talents indeed music great source improving lives many children well learning experience learning music instruments requires patience creativity good discipline inherently order master music instrument good musician needs sharpen preserverence offer best great performance often demands ten years practice heart musician pursuation perfection persistence good qualities child learn throughout life pursuing career career music however despite good qualities obtained playing music instruments childhood education misdirected development hobbie becomes mandatory ocurse includes music instruments might beneficial child experiment music instruments early years every child potential professional musician making music mandatory subject primary secondary school students could minimize opportunities discover different hobbies moreover making bobbie mandatory subject may also hinder learning experiences young child imagine stressful study unecessary subject top regular courses homework harms goods overall learning experience conclusion might beneficial child learn music instruments first school years talent enjoy music educators consider dropping suggestion let discover hobbies

It is clear that at the beginning of the period the vast majority of people were working in agriculture, fishing industry and logging, while other occupations were not so popular. However, by 2010 the situation had changed dramatically.
A more detailed look at the graph reveals that in 1930 a little less than 80 percent of the US citizens were farming, fishing and cutting trees. This proportion was going down at a slow pace untill 1970. At the same period the number of people working in othere areas was fluctuating at levels from 0% to approximately 15%.

2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.
First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.
Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.
What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.
To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.",,,,,,6.5,commonly known music always played important role upbringing children lot parents wish kids play musical instrument however disagree skill essential every pupil first people born talent music essential one wants learn play people natural musicians succeed sphere ease hand children learning play hard work eventually might start hating music instead enjoying people bound become excellent engineers doctors learning read play music waste time another important factor kids different reason desires different hobby pupils spent time music interested would less time things really exciting undoubtedly everybody right spend free time way want playing musical instrument considered essential skill successful career time devoted important subjects math science languages chance useful people grow graduate school sum teaching children play instrument would good idea taught really want would ditract child subjects hobbies important opinion also mastered everybody

2,"Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","There are opposite views as to which stage of life would exert the most influence on a child's life. Some people hold that the pre-school life is the most influential, while others disagree and claim that the teenage life, notably the period of staying at school, would be more important to his/her life. This essay is to evaluate both views and demonstrate my opinion.
Before entering the school, children usually receive the most influence from their parents and friends. At home, children would spend much time with their parents teaching them a variety of knowledge needed to help an adolescent act properly and get recognised by the society in the future. When staying outside, children would also be influenced by their friends or other peers since children tend to resemble the behaviours of their peers in order to integrate into the social group of adolescents.
In the school life, a child's personality would be shaped both by classmates who frequently interact with the child and potentially affect the child, and by teachers presenting knowledge in various fields of science and liberal arts so as to help the child obtain a basic understanding to the world.
As far as I am concerned, it is rather arbitrary to conclude which period of life would be more important than the other, since a child's psychological development is too complex to be understood. After all, the importance of pre-school life or teenage period might vary from one child to another. Children have their respective understandings as to which person deserves their admiration and which period of life teaches them the best lesson.
To sum up, children would be influenced by different persons in different periods of life. It depends on children's own intention as to which period is more pivotal, and which person should be admired.",,,,,,7.5,opposite views stage life would exert influence child life people hold life influential others disagree claim teenage life notably period staying school would important life essay evaluate views demonstrate opinion entering school children usually receive influence parents friends home children would spend much time parents teaching variety knowledge needed help adolescent act properly get recognised society future staying outside children would also influenced friends peers since children tend resemble behaviours peers order integrate social group adolescents school life child personality would shaped classmates frequently interact child potentially affect child teachers presenting knowledge various fields science liberal arts help child obtain basic understanding world far concerned rather arbitrary conclude period life would important since child psychological development complex understood importance life teenage period might vary one child another children respective understandings person deserves admiration period life teaches best lesson sum children would influenced different persons different periods life depends children intention period pivotal person admired

On one hand, it is the fact that experiences or events happend during their childhood or before they starting to go to school can highly attached to their memories.

On the other hand, there are higher varieties of experiences occurred during teenage stage of life, in which are more recognizable both from an external factors like their friends, family or their environments in school.

Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","The experiences a child goes through during different stages of life defines his personality and have great impact on his future. Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.
Those people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.
On the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.

In this essay I will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why I feel that there are better advatages.
The most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them.
Some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick.
In conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older.

In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.
Firstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.
In addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.
Finally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.

On the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.
In conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools.

Furthermore, I hold on firmly to the belief that, children should learn how to respect the environment, especially the agriculture such as vegetables and the wildlife as animals.
To begin with, children should learn how to cultivate and grow vegetables, in order to respect the environment. In other words, children may experience some extra activities related to plants cultivation during or after school. For instance, educational institutions could organise some apprenticeship activities and teach how to cultivate and grow vegetables. In addition to this, it often claimed that taking part in these types of activities may develop children's skills and acquiring leadership skills. Moreover, young students could experience different types of cultivation, in order to gain knowledge of agriculture sector. Therefore, these may be useful for children's career prospects and for their future.
Secondly, another vital aspect of our world that should be considered is the wildlife, especially there some animals endangered. In other words, animals have become significant for the world's ecosystems and useful for companionship. For example, it is generally agreed that children may have to learn how to maintain animals. Additionally, children could experience activities in animals protection associations, in order to learn how to keep and protect animals with the support of some volunteers. As a result, children when they grow up are aware to the fact that animals are important and have to be always appreciated and respected.
In conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, the advantages of learning how to cultivate vegetables and keep animals definitely outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, there is no doubt that children doing these activities may gain many positive experiences, develop their skills and learn how value and appreciate the environment including wildlife.",,,,,,7.5,nowadays widely believed education become important aspect lives especially primary children well educated achieving period adolescence furthermore hold firmly belief children learn respect environment especially agriculture vegetables wildlife animals begin children learn cultivate grow vegetables order respect environment words children may experience extra activities related plants cultivation school instance educational institutions could organise apprenticeship activities teach cultivate grow vegetables addition often claimed taking part types activities may develop children skills acquiring leadership skills moreover young students could experience different types cultivation order gain knowledge agriculture sector therefore may useful children career prospects future secondly another vital aspect world considered wildlife especially animals endangered words animals become significant world ecosystems useful companionship example generally agreed children may learn maintain animals additionally children could experience activities animals protection associations order learn keep protect animals support volunteers result children grow aware fact animals important always appreciated respected conclusion far concerned advantages learning cultivate vegetables keep animals definitely outweigh drawbacks additionally doubt children activities may gain many positive experiences develop skills learn value appreciate environment including wildlife

2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills. Although there are controversial views towards this proposal, I believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below.
On the one hand, experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run. Firstly, by involving in the process of vegetables growing, children gain in-depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle. In this case, they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants. Secondly, keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils' responsibility. As they learn how to rountinely feed animals, and take showers for them, their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand, which would lay a solid foundation for their future study, family life and professional career.
On the other hand, it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study. It is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools. For example, their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class. The empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers.

2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.
The main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.
However, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.

Recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.
It is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. This essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.
To commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. As children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. Furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. For instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. Thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.
Additionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. As a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. For example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.
On the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. Addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. If a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. There are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.
Moreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. Nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. Using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children's Development is one of the most priorities for most of the parents and they want to ensure that their children get all the needed interventions for their children's progress. Some people think that playing outside provide more benefits compared to playing computer games. As a child who experienced both, I agree that playing outside is more beneficial.
Outdoor activities give children the opportunity to show and enhance their physical, mental, and social abilities. If a child plays in the park, he tends to explore different parts of the field by running or walking, and this develops his physical health. Joining a camping could help a kid develop his problem-solving skills, making him use his basic knowledge about the activity. A kid can also meet different children on a playground, with the same wave-length as his, and this allows him develop to be sociable to others.
On the other hand, computer games also gives kids a chance to develop their mental capabilities to the point that some get addicted playing it. Another disadvantage is it does not enable children to enhance their physical development. Other computer games offer problem-solving activities, logics, and reasoning, making children to exercise their cognitive abilities. Some games overstimulate the brain, to the point that a player can get hooked and addicted to it to play long hours. In addition, most of the computer games are not physically interactive, and let the players sit during the entire game. This would not benefit children to develop their muscles.
Although computer games could benefit children mentally but it has different disadvantages that outweighs the advantage of it.

The main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing

2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming. In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.
The reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.
In addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.
In conclusion, outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children, not only for their personalities to be formed and developed, but also for their understanding to multiple real-life situations.",,,,,,8.5,groups society idea outdoor activities vital children improve mental physical skills rather gaming opinion agree crafts physical interaction kids essential development aspects modern technology contains computer games may negative effects overall development reason believe activities important kids building personalities first years life building process requires play interact peers situations without doubt done online games offer rich experience example child faces friends communicates face face activities learn things contribute growth many ways addition reason outdoor activities offer authentic exposure different situations helps children learn deal manage actions increase awareness hand computer games provide exposure may needed achieve benefits illustrate children play outside houses mates generally give specific quick response different situations contrast spend hours infront computer screens conclusion outdoor activities valuable give children personalities formed developed also understanding multiple situations
1,"The diagram gives information about the process of making carbonated drinks.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","The diagram illustrates the process of producing carbonated drinks.
There are five main stages of making carbonated drinks (water cleaning, heating evaporation and carbonation, mixing, filtering and filling, packing).
The whole process of producing carbonated drinks begins with raw water, which goes through the water filter. Then, a water softener and some chemicals are added to the filtered water. A pump brings the water to stage 2, where water is heated and then goes through a cooling pipe. After, the water goes through the carbonation process. Then, the carbonated water goes to the mixing stage; meanwhile, the mixing tank adds colouring, syrup and flavour.
Stage 4 is filtering and filling the ready product in the boxes. After mixing, the drink goes through the filter once more and after that is filled in bottles or cans.

2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.
Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.
The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.
Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation.
There are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country.
Moreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air.
On the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","To be a part of a modern society people must follow laws that are set in place by the superior authorities. Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.
Some people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.
The society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.
To conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to. Ultimately, our society could not function as it does now, if there would be no laws and rules to follow, and the possibility of serious consequences if those are broken.",,,,,,7.5,part modern society people must follow laws set place superior authorities agree would rules society could function way essay argue rules laws necessary functioning society people high moral standarts even would rules would act exactly rules set place people geniunely kind would never want cheat ir cause harm another person law makes act way rather personality values everyone would like laws would necessary people would act humane want best eachother society live could exist without rules laws set place control everyone different different value system understanding acceptable action people believe ok steal another cheat harm another person thing tries keep place system law enforcement promises consequences rules broken many people enough live rules however even laws set place still break benifit people commit crime knowing punished many would harm would consequences action reasons world could run without regulated system law conclude even though people naturally follow rules enough functioning society many others would feel free want ultimately society could function would laws rules follow possibility serious consequences broken

2,"Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.
Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.
Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'
From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles.

One unconsidered point, is how the front and the back sides were not as thin and skinny as effective as the side angle. But not as essential.

The front in addition to the rear hand side views; had displayed no changes if related to the side one.

2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","One of the main objectives of technology is to facilitate people's lives. Nowadays, modern technology has been created to help people in several aspects of their daily lives, one of them being shopping. Some people consider that modern technology has made shopping easier, whereas, some detractors consider that these new technological gadgets have made it more difficult. I highly agree that the current technology has facilitate shopping due to the reasons explained in the following paragraphs.
On the one hand, technology has made shopping easier, because it saves people's money and time. Regarding shopping, new websites, such as, Amazon and Whish, as well as, applications, like Cornershop and Uber Eats, have enabled people to buy food, clothes and various goods from the confort of their homes. Thus, it is no longer necessary to travel to a shop, waste time in a queue and spend money in a parking ticket. This means that people can use the time that was spend in shopping on other activities (i.e., reading a book, doing sports, cooking, among others).
Moreover, technology enabled a new and varied competition in the market, making it possible that small shops, which were uknown and did not have the resources to have a physical space, now can be famous known. For instance, ""Mercado Libre"" (Free Market in English) is a website that helped several sellers make their products known to the public.
One the other hand, some detractors may indicate that technology has made shopping today more difficult, due to the lack of interpersonal relationship between the seller and the buyer. This hindrance makes it impossible to test the product before buying it. Nowadays, several people prefer staying at home and buy what they need in the internet or in an application, not being possible to have a face to face conversation with the person that it is selling a product. However, websites and applications have reviews by the consumers of the products, therefore, people can be informed of a good before it is bought.

2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions. Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.
On the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.
At the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.
As for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.
I can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable.

2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.
One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.
Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.
Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.
In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.",,,,,,7.0,commonly argued fast pacing technology helped people shopping present time easily however people think online shopping really difficult essay consider advantages disadvantages use technology shopping one disadvantage online shopping mentioned people familiarize online applications ordering essential goods food fact elderly good technology enough go virtual supermarkets besides live remote areas accessible easily technology buy online groceries despite disadvantage online shopping brought advantages technology natives firstly fact shoppers order things need clicks items payment method time delivery especially lingering social distancing measures effective places viet nam according survey number online shoppers increasing day day thus many applications existence developed thrived another advantage virtual shopping many people pandemic across nations going supermarkets detrimental buyers due spread viruses higher risk infection example order buy bread breakfast people go thus may exposed infectious incubated victims moreover preventive measures containment people allowed go essential goods know make online order really difficult survive pandemic conclusion use technology virtual shopping beneficial matters though familiar people opinion thanks advantages continue go shopping online though world gone pandemic successfully

Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.

2,"In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.
First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.
Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.
To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.",,,,,,7.0,classical music one oldest artistic samples history however young people new generations appreciate kind music believe governments encourage young people learn classical music support stand valid arguments following paragraphs first main reason behind little interest young people classical music impact globalization music arts people opportunity know multiple things without leaving homes however knowledge superficial arts specifically classical music diminished big international industry music instance reggaeton music despite fact lyrics often misogynous popular style music days another reason children young people less interest cultural matters past governments invest culture arts countries investment culture drastically reduced young people access classical music concerts much less musical instrument huge cost consequently governments encourage young people learn classical music arts summarise essay examined idea classical music young people interest kind music far concerned governments take responsibility matter invest money culture classical music encouraging young people learn kind art

This section provides details on the present water supply system. Present water supply system consists of a dam which is used to store the water which is collected from rains.Once the dams are filled with water the pure water is supplied to household, factories and the cities for use. The waste water from the commecial sectors is sent to water treatment plant for treatment.Any water from the storms is supplied to the rivers.
Although supply system is a comprehensive water supply and storage system the storm water released into the rivers is not treated to ensure clean water is being released, this could lead to pollution of the rivers.Dams are generally built to hold the river water and collect rain water but it seems the dam is independent of the river, hence building a dam along the river would allow australia to have a better supply of water.Also, the treated waste water can be supplied back for commercial use or released into the river.

2,"In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Why Classical Music has not garnered the attention and recognition it deserves?.In this article we will cover all factors that have led to this question and will also provide my views on this highly debated topic.
Classical music which is considered one of the oldest forms of music. It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.
This has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.
For example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.
Classical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.
Howerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.
In conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook.",,,,,,7.5,classical music garnered attention recognition deserves article cover factors led question also provide views highly debated topic classical music considered one oldest forms music part look early 1800 early 1900 always classical music garnered attention people coming concert halls listen integral part music evolution music introduction genres music like rock pop rap seen rise music people found appealing intresting led classical music viewed boring stagnant viewed primary cause fall popularity classical music example going rock roll concert gets people involved also allows opportunity partake concert could understand would appeal youth compared classical concert people would view appreciate minimum involvement classical music also skilled art needs learned honed integrate modern art example michael jackson integrated dancing singing widely appealed masses encouraged youth concerts could see similar integration classical music concerts could attract youth towards classcial music howerver discussion forget various genres music derived classical music youth learning classical music attending classical concerts would help achieve future music endevors also give good understanding music conclusion say young people encouraged go classical music concerts would help understand appreciate music true attracting young towards classical music need evolution classical music concert structure integrate components forms would make blend better present day outlook

Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.
Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.

2,"Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.
While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.
Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.
In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats.

In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness.

In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.
The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.
Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.

This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.
The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.
The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.

2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no doubt that these days student's punishment decreased in most schools. Some people believe that physical punishment is important to improve behaviour. While others totally disagree with that. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of people who agree with the student's punishment, they think that students need it to improve their attitude and to be good at school. To illustrate, when teachers physically punish students, Students will follow their instructions and avoid doing mistakes. In addition, other students will be carefule when they think to do any wrongs to avoid the punishment. So that will lead to seeing students who behave well and do no mistakes.
However, some people believe that using corpral as a physical punishment has negative effects on the students. Firstly, students who face physical ounishment from their schools will have many psychological issues like fear, low self confidence, and isolation. Secondly, theses students will hate going to school and continuing their education in the future due to this punishment. For example, students will think of school as a scary place instead of thinking of it as an education site. So it is very normal that they are going to avoid going there.
In conclusion, althogh some people agree with using corporal punishment, several people have their reasons to disagree with that. I believe that using corporal punishment or any kind of punishment with students at scool nowdays is unethical practice and should be avoided since there are a lot of ways to teach students to not do the wrong things.",,,,,,6.5,doubt days student punishment decreased schools people believe physical punishment important improve behaviour others totally disagree essay going discuss views draw personal conclusion terms people agree student punishment think students need improve attitude good school illustrate teachers physically punish students students follow instructions avoid mistakes addition students carefule think wrongs avoid punishment lead seeing students behave well mistakes however people believe using corpral physical punishment negative effects students firstly students face physical ounishment schools many psychological issues like fear low self confidence isolation secondly theses students hate going school continuing education future due punishment example students think school scary place instead thinking education site normal going avoid going conclusion althogh people agree using corporal punishment several people reasons disagree believe using corporal punishment kind punishment students scool nowdays unethical practice avoided since lot ways teach students wrong things

In general, from 2002 to 2005 the number of cameras showed uneven upward trend while deaths and accidents fluctuated, however both insignificantly increased in the end of the period compared to the beginning.
Installed speed cameras in Melbourne increased from around 30 in 2002 to almost 150 in 2005, however the growth was not even. The most significant increase was in the end of the analysed period when about 75 new cameras were introduced compared to prior 2004 year which gives appropximate half of the increase within one year.

2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Despite the fact that physical punishment of pupils at schools is decreasing, it is considered by many that it improves discipline. This essay completely disagrees with this view because such measures are applied to those who are unable to counterattack and it maybe the easiest way but also the most inhumane.
Firstly, physical assault is usually applied by teachers against children who are not able to stop the violence. In other words, it is not highly probable that an adolescent will try to hurt a teenager who may stop the hitting or even push it back. Thus, kids are at higher risk because the only thing they are able to do in such cases is just try to run away. Moreover, children should understand that they earn what they deserve meaning that the level of repercussions should correspond to the seriousness of so called crime. For example, Sweden schools have publicly available the set of rules and non-physical measures that will be taken against the violators, that confirms that other methods are also effective to keep appropriate kids’ behaviour.
Secondly, it is much more easier for many to maintain a discipline using the fear of corporal punishment. This means that it seems unnecessary and time-waste for grown-ups to try to apply other methods while a hectic kid may be calmed down just in few seconds using the fear of pain. Pupils may not be involved in a lesson and interrupt a teacher because they are not interested in the subject that may be caused by the fact that the teacher was not able to select appropriate technics to convey knowledge. For example, a research conducted by a US institution revealed that 90% of corporal punishments were applied to pupils who did not l listened to their teachers during a lesson.
In conclusion, physical violence should be discontinued in schools because mostly weak kids are in danger and they are subject for such punishments because adolescents chose the simplest way of violence and fear to better the behaviour.",,,,,,6.5,despite fact physical punishment pupils schools decreasing considered many improves discipline essay completely disagrees view measures applied unable counterattack maybe easiest way also inhumane firstly physical assault usually applied teachers children able stop violence words highly probable adolescent try hurt teenager may stop hitting even push back thus kids higher risk thing able cases try run away moreover children understand earn deserve meaning level repercussions correspond seriousness called crime example sweden schools publicly available set rules measures taken violators confirms methods also effective keep appropriate kids behaviour secondly much easier many maintain discipline using fear corporal punishment means seems unnecessary try apply methods hectic kid may calmed seconds using fear pain pupils may involved lesson interrupt teacher interested subject may caused fact teacher able select appropriate technics convey knowledge example research conducted us institution revealed 90 corporal punishments applied pupils l listened teachers lesson conclusion physical violence discontinued schools mostly weak kids danger subject punishments adolescents chose simplest way violence fear better behaviour

Although it has been declined, some argue that it should be used to exceel the conduct. I personally disagree with this notion because physical punishment compromise the mental and physical well-being of students.
It is well-established that in the modern times educational procedures have changed hugely compared with previous decades. For instance, psychologists were not part of the school staff before the modern times. Today pupils behaviour is analysed throughout systems and complex theories in order to understand their apptitudes before to produce judgements and punishments. When in the past students were drastically hitting by educators, it repercuted in negative consequences because physical and mental traumas resulted as a product of this practice. Some pupils developed violent behaviours and others suffered from lack of confidence and self-harmed, even some of them commited suicide.
Despite the negative evidence of corporal punishment on students, the education system implemented new methods and modalities to maintain the students bahaviour. First of all, the physical punishment was entire banned from schools, even, teachers might face legal meassures if they impart this kind of punishment. Secondly, psychologists play an important role in schools today because they are able to understand the social environment of students, thus, they know what mechanisms use to improve their behaviour. For instance, these professionals are capable to use a bunch of principles, values and speechs that are scientifically proved leaving the physical punishment behind in the history.
To conclude, corporal punishment was used in the past to control students behaviour, nowadays it has been drastically reduced Nonetheless some claim that it should be used again to improve conducts. I strongly disagree with this statement because it is proved that this practice caused negative impacts in students life, furthermore, new professions and methods are implemented which have demostrated high rates of efficacy to pursuade and improve the well-behaviour in students.",,,,,,6.0,common knowledge corporal punishment used school previous generations although declined argue used exceel conduct personally disagree notion physical punishment compromise mental physical students modern times educational procedures changed hugely compared previous decades instance psychologists part school staff modern times today pupils behaviour analysed throughout systems complex theories order understand apptitudes produce judgements punishments past students drastically hitting educators repercuted negative consequences physical mental traumas resulted product practice pupils developed violent behaviours others suffered lack confidence even commited suicide despite negative evidence corporal punishment students education system implemented new methods modalities maintain students bahaviour first physical punishment entire banned schools even teachers might face legal meassures impart kind punishment secondly psychologists play important role schools today able understand social environment students thus know mechanisms use improve behaviour instance professionals capable use bunch principles values speechs scientifically proved leaving physical punishment behind history conclude corporal punishment used past control students behaviour nowadays drastically reduced nonetheless claim used improve conducts strongly disagree statement proved practice caused negative impacts students life furthermore new professions methods implemented demostrated high rates efficacy pursuade improve students

However, there was a remarakable difference between percentages of accidents and deaths that occurred during the four-year period.
With regard to the speed-camera use, it is evident that the increase was huge over the four-year period, moving from just above 25 speed cameras in 2002 to almost 150 in 2005, about six times as much.

I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.
Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.
Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.
In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes.

In the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. I believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.
Recent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. According to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. Students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. But students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.
Besides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. Scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. This leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.
Most importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. There are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. To increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. But there are some good news. Humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.
In general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. It's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays.

It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.
One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.
The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.
In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.",,,,,,7.0,internet recently become widely spread means communication knowledge sharing argued many restrictions imposed essay discuss views explain internet free regulations one group people consider internet developed overcome government censure thus restrictions destroy purpose despite fact independent media practically difficult share news internally internationally low speed communication methods telegraph post lead fact common source information government authorities selected information wanted share thus general citizens opinion views problems often unheard essay agrees ability sharing information freely people world makes government transparent everyone opinion problem may heard example problems extinction wild animals baikal region russia due forest cuts heard massive attack media local citizens bloggers would impossible without internet others insist internet allows people share useful knowledge problems new also violent content supporters view believe easy access content example assault production bombs people become prompt criminal behaviour although internet makes violent information available essay suggests individual want find violent information would even absence internet moreover recent researches conducted criminalists uncovered increase number criminal offenses directly correlated internet coverage conclusion although internet contains violent content needed may accessed interested people sources informations meanwhile independent flow information allows individuals attract attention local even global problems may hidden governments without free internet

However, it is being frecuently controversial, because whereas some claim to control it, others request its entire freedom. In my opinion, Internet needs to be controlled and in some instances it needs to be restricted.
Internet is a useful modern technology that has changed the methods of communication and the information storage. However, it is vital to establish regulations in its use, because, even though, it is a great technological advance that improved the communication and information procedures. it is also a powerful mechanism that might impact negatively the human lives. For instance, internet can be use to obtain personal information that could be use in unlawful ways such as supplant identities to commit virtual crimes. Therefore, if internet is not use within legal frames, the probabilities of intranet crimes are likely to increase in the entire society.
On the other hand, some people claim for its freedom because they do not want to be surveillanced. Althouth some people claim for freedom of their privacy, it looks like they do not understand the importance of a set of rules within the internet to protect privacy. For instance, some couples like to share nude images and videos between themselves through social media apps. however, there is evidence that these kind of content have been stolen to blackmail the couples in return for not revealing their compromising information. Therefore, if people claim for freedom when navigating into the red, it is crucial to have legal parameteres that might help to protect their privacy.

As for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. Such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. Given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.
On the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. A case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. However, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. To address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.
As far as I am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.

As for those agreeing with the control of online activities, they have their position grounded upon the fact that numerous criminal activities run rampant online and should be tackled effectively, as exemplified by fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and hacking technologies targeted at violating privacy. If unchecked, cybercrimes would increasingly disturb the society and cause widespread complaints. Another reason reinforcing this position is that the online information that is inappropriate for minors should be reduced, such as the movies containing erotic or violent scenes, as well as foul language. Otherwise, children may be led astray by such information, acting improperly at home or school.
In terms of those who barely support online control, they may justify their position by explaining the importance of unlimited internet access to task efficiency. For instance, businessmen could seek potential clients by online searching, which is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street publicizing themselves. However, if internet users cannot identify the authenticity of online information, they may assume the risk of being cheated. Given this concern, a certain extent of intervention is needed for screening fake information.

It has dramatically changed how we communicate with each other and how we obtain news. With only one push of button on our devices like a smart phone or a laptop we can speak our family members who are thousand miles away from us or read current news without a need for watching TV or buying a newspaper. However, this convenience of the Internet carries some potential threats to the users such as violation of their privacy rights and overflow of unreliable information. Therefore, the users should demand some forms of regulations of the Internet to reduce these risks.
Certainly, the use of the Internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. Unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the Internet. For example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. However, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. This practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the Internet. For this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the Internet.
Another risk of having the Internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. I find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the Internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. Now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the Internet. Simply, people can write and post their comments that often don’t have any factual or scientific base. We have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the COVID-19.

Since the advent of internet, life has been a whole lot better than it used to be.People can now get information at the confort of their beds or even while on transit.

However, there are some demerits of the internet. To start with, it is slowly killing the culture of meeting up with friends and family physically. Due to the fact that you can easily text or call them on phone , majority of individuals now rarely spend time with their friends and loved ones. This will apparently have a negative effect on the bonds of the relatoinships. Secondly, the internet can serve as a tool to spread false informations that can tarnish one's reputation. Take for instance, the senate president of Nigeria was falsely accused of a scandalous affair with an actress. This malicious accusation not only destroyed his home but also costed him his job.

Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",,,,,,5.5,recent years people tend move big cities countryside increasing extremely especially developed countries including japan therefore total population country seems changed balance population widening decades would like share example japan suggest ideas reverse population countryside mainly job opportunities big cities much higher countryside majority companies foreign company branches tend located tokyo osaka therefore people need move big cities suburbs area get jobs means real estate house apartment prices soaring drastically moreover phenomenon connects prices rise variety industries example food prices restaurants need raise due monthly tenants payment surging therefore people easily get change job big cities necessarily wealthy nevertheless ironically since widely spread worldwide many companies launched remote work even majority people need commute office addition companies declare never change working system future already systemized system able work remotely therefore great chance japanese government dissipate population local cities people start move local cities countryside population local cities countryside increased helpful people live reasonable prices also effective economic growth local cities countryside addition local governments able organize infrastructure roads medical care education result quality infrastructure close big cities finally government financially supported remote working system companies phenomenon available result disparity wealth wider people able get job opportunities living countryside

It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.
Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.
Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.
Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.",,,,,,7.0,people move countryside cities occurs many parts world causing problems especially urban areas essay elaborate causes movement way reversed personal standpoint centralization caused movement major institutions facilities cities thus people rural areas sacrifice considerable time effort travel urban centres also costly people choose move cities traveling consume time instance total population korea currently lives seoul capital city korea fact educational medical entertainment facilities centralized urban areas reserved implementing decentralization government disperse location major institutions diverse types facilities different districts people living remote areas also benefit furthermore people remote areas want earn opportunities better employment education city point technologies investments professions gather better opportunity people get employed educated improved quality therefore people choose leave countryside thereby government initiate policies firms earn benefit move head office districts firms commence moving produce great amount employment conclusively government also businesses institutions combat problems resulting surge movement people countryside cities

In my opinion, some of the causes might be the transition from agricultural to technological economies and the lack of support from governments to coutryside economy. I will suggest that major support and promotion of the agricultural services might encourage people to stay at coutryside.
The national migration is a well-know fact that happen into the countries as a product of technological advancements and its impact in the national and international economy. The service sector is nowadays the main activity within the countries, which resulted in more opportunities along the the cities of the world because this sector is mainly located in cosmopolitan areas, therefore, rural people have decided to emigrate to the cities seeking to improve their standard of living. Additionally, with the growth of the service sector, governments have reduced the funding for countryside which resulted in high rates of unemployed people in that regions. This lack of support, encourage the movement of people as a negative side effects in the cities because of overcowded populations.
In order to mitigate the overcrowded populations accross the cities in the world, it is crucial to support and promote the country side economies to avoid the movement of people domestically. Governmments need to increase the budged allocated to rural areas, but additionally, they ought to provide better systems to promote and increase the participation of agricultural economies. If farmers find the adecuate support to produce the farms, they are less unlikely to abandond their lands because they already have a livelyhood. This support may impact benefically in cities because differents social issues could be reduced.

However, this rapid migration has led to popluation explosion in cities which seems to put tremendous pressure on available resources. In order to restore normalcy, this movement ought to be reversed and this can be done in a number of ways.
To begin with, the most common reason why people move to urban centers from rural areas is the fact that urban areas provide a wide range of opportunities that enable people to live a better life. For instance, all major metropolitan areas in the world provide access to state-of-the-art facilties in healthcare and education. Needless to say, both these aspects are the piilars of a good quality life that every individual desires to live. Unfortunately, as rural areas generally lag far behind in both these aspects, people are forced to migrate to cities. Moreover, urban dwellers are undoubtedly benefitted by advancements in all avenues of inquiry compared to their rural counterparts. This is because of the speed with which urban areas are able to incorporate these advancments into their infrastructure. While it may take a couple of months for a technological innovation to make its way to a village, it is not uncommon to see resdidents of a city making use of that innovation within no time. Thus, it makes perfect sense for people to leave the countryside in order to settle in cities.
However, cities are suffering from a host of problems because of large number of people opting to settle here. Firstly, accomodating a burgeoning population is a grave challenge that grips cities. This can be circumvented by providing villages with the basic facilties essential to support life. This would deter people from migrating to cities. Besides, if attempts are made to integrate rural areas into the mainstream, they would be benefitted by latest technological developments and people would no longer feel the need to move to cities in order to take advantage of those advancements.
To conclude, although there are many reasons why individuals are migrating from the countryside into the cities in many parts of the world, if development in rural areas is emphazised upon, this trend could be reversed.",,,,,,8.0,many parts across globe people migrating rural areas urban areas search better life however rapid migration led popluation explosion cities seems put tremendous pressure available resources order restore normalcy movement ought reversed done number ways begin common reason people move urban centers rural areas fact urban areas provide wide range opportunities enable people live better life instance major metropolitan areas world provide access facilties healthcare education needless say aspects piilars good quality life every individual desires live unfortunately rural areas generally lag far behind aspects people forced migrate cities moreover urban dwellers undoubtedly benefitted advancements avenues inquiry compared rural counterparts speed urban areas able incorporate advancments infrastructure may take couple months technological innovation make way village uncommon see resdidents city making use innovation within time thus makes perfect sense people leave countryside order settle cities however cities suffering host problems large number people opting settle firstly accomodating burgeoning population grave challenge grips cities circumvented providing villages basic facilties essential support life would deter people migrating cities besides attempts made integrate rural areas mainstream would benefitted latest technological developments people would longer feel need move cities order take advantage advancements conclude although many reasons individuals migrating countryside cities many parts world development rural areas emphazised upon trend could reversed

I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.
First, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.
Although I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.

To start with, we have to consider the logic behind this movement. Firstly, as a rule, the countryside does not have enough educational institutions, so after finishing high school most students are obliged to move to other parts of the country in order to obtain higher education and, eventually, apply for well-paid jobs that are available only in bigger cities. Secondly, despite being provided with basic services, people still feel the lack of entertainment facilities, such as cinemas, theaters and others. In other words, most of the rural population is bored and have nothing else to do, that is why they are bound to immigrate to urban areas.
Luckily, there are a number of solutions, which could be implemented and, hopefully, they can solve or, at least, ease the situation. Initially, it is vitally important that the government allocates more funds to rural areas and use this money for construction of public amenities such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and others. If those facilities were introduced, then villagers would have fewer incentives to move. The second option that we have to consider is to promote living in the countryside by providing tax cuts, subsidies and other measures of economic stimulation, which could prove to be effective in the long run.
All things considered, it can be clearly seen that the lack of facilities and money are the two most important reasons as to why more villagers move to the cities. Unless the government provides a number of economic incentives along with public facilities, it might be difficult to overturn this trend.",,,,,,7.5,nowadays world families immigrate rural urban areas situation leads number undesirable consequences city residents regions general essay shall try cover reasons trend well provide number solutions start consider logic behind movement firstly rule countryside enough educational institutions finishing high school students obliged move parts country order obtain higher education eventually apply jobs available bigger cities secondly despite provided basic services people still feel lack entertainment facilities cinemas theaters others words rural population bored nothing else bound immigrate urban areas luckily number solutions could implemented hopefully solve least ease situation initially vitally important government allocates funds rural areas use money construction public amenities hospitals schools kindergartens others facilities introduced villagers would fewer incentives move second option consider promote living countryside providing tax cuts subsidies measures economic stimulation could prove effective long run things considered clearly seen lack facilities money two important reasons villagers move cities unless government provides number economic incentives along public facilities might difficult overturn trend

2,"Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.
In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.
It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.
Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.
I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.",,,,,,5.5,weather children one important questions young adults ask themselfs nowadays overpopulation one many global problems next climate change poverty opinion need children roots back us nothing civilised animals animals one goal reproduce many cultures men women chlidren seen disabled sick nowadays modern values changed perspective children often seen necessity happy successful life important recognise problems developed world faces smoke air plastic pollution everywhere poverty third world countries many factors make earth terrible place many life give birth eat drink consume like everyone else using already limited resources generating trash many people argue mentioned points pessimistic unrealistic humans reproduce keep species extintion truthfully way give birth many kids possible issue lies deep society hungary family rewared almost 30000 usd 3 kids means many people children get money also seen socially accepted believe modern day intelligence goes iq points money earned recognise problems created overpopulation one believe kids think careful planning involved giving birth new life

Overall, the production could be split into three main stages: preliminary stage, where a raw material is retrieved and processed, main stage, where the actual manufactoring is done, and final stage which finishes with delievery of the product.
The first stage is designated to the delivery of material and its initial preparations such as cutting, spraying with a fire retardant and cleaning.
The second stage is occupied by manufactoring of the end product. It could be seen that this process forms a cycle with the following steps: automated IC attachment and soldering, visual inspection and quality contron testing. The latter step may lead to the board rejection, next iteration of the cycle, or the final testing depending on its result. The final testing either leads to the next iteration as well, or to the last stage.

It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is really dangerous sport which usually leads to physical injuries. However, I do not agree that it is inappropriate for the modern age to has such a sport, since it is a huge part of our culture and many people actually enjoy watching it.
To begin with, boxing is depicted as blood but fair and honorable sport in different kinds of art, such as literature and cinema. For instance, Ernest Hemingway has a number of stories related to this sport in his book ""Men Without Women"", and there are also various movies about boxing. A one may become boxer for different reasons: it could be encouraged by existing culture, it could be a wish to fight fairly without any lie which is rarely achievable in life outside sport, or a way to throw out internal aggression. In any way, it is his or her freedom of choise whether to take part in this sport or not, and I believe it is absolutely not appropriate to forbid people boxing.
Furthermore, people actually like watching boxing, otherwise it would not be so popular. They associate themselves with a sportsman and experience rush and adrenaline along with him. After a competetion, fans usually feel relief as after great movie, except they know that all the action took place in real life, which is not a case for movies. This perception of reality increases the feelings greatly, leading to more fascinating experience.
In the end, I want to underline this again: I believe that boxing is totally appropriete for the modern world, along with other extreme sports, and its cancellation would be absolutely unfair and generally bad, even though it is undisputably very injury-prone.",,,,,,5.5,boxing really dangerous sport usually leads physical injuries however agree inappropriate modern age sport since huge part culture many people actually enjoy watching begin boxing depicted blood fair honorable sport different kinds art literature cinema instance ernest hemingway number stories related sport book men without women also various movies boxing one may become boxer different reasons could encouraged existing culture could wish fight fairly without lie rarely achievable life outside sport way throw internal aggression way freedom choise whether take part sport believe absolutely appropriate forbid people boxing furthermore people actually like watching boxing otherwise would popular associate sportsman experience rush adrenaline along competetion fans usually feel relief great movie except know action took place real life case movies perception reality increases feelings greatly leading fascinating experience end want underline believe boxing totally appropriete modern world along extreme sports cancellation would absolutely unfair generally bad even though undisputably

After that, a circuit-board material should be cleaned and delivered to another sector of production. According to the data, automated IC attachment and soldering are being used in this sector.

Some people tend to believe that this sport should not exist nowadays. This controversial statement has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that boxing is an excellent way to fit a body and improve coordination. For instance, if parents want their kids to know how to defend themselves, they let them attend boxing masterclasses. However, the main aim for parents is to find a skilled, experienced coach for their children. They may think if a teacher is an expert, their kids will not suffer during training. Notwithstanding, it does not always work like that.
On the other hand, a lot of people completely disagree that boxing as a business industry has a right to exist in the modern world. They are convinced that people who fight should not suffer because of the wishes of rich people who enjoy the show. For example, if a young person gets a physical injury during a fight, he will probably get money for that; however, it does not mean that he will get better after the final battle. Also, people who protest against this blood sport probably dislike advertisements related to boxing. They may think that even these videos impact people's behaviour and motivate them to commit violence against others.
In conclusion, boxing is a part of the blood business that should be forbidden in the modern age.

But that might be suprising, since it is a violent sport that often results in serious injuries of the participants. As a developed society, who at large condemns fighting, the continued interest can be seen as undermining our values and beliefs.
While using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. Everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. Furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. Those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. Additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.
On the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. The promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. Since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. Another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. Frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.

Following the IC attachment and soldering, there will be two stages of quality oversight, including visual inspection and quality control testing and final testing. If each of the inspection stages identifies any substandard products, the chips from such rejected products will be discarded.

As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.
Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.
Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.

2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"There are many factors to encourage the quality of societies, some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities. The following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies.
First of all, if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport, you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him. For example ,a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview, that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother, he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level, the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games. The competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality.
secondly, competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study. For example, my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math, the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students, the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson, she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them. Nowadays, my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems. Furthermore, competitions can improve people's career, and increase company's outcome, some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well.
To conclude, competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study, also employers will develop their skills, as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend.",,,,,,6.0,many factors encourage quality societies people believe competitiveness main factor improve communities following essay focus importance competitiveness individuals cite opinion believe positive trend develop societies first want improve skill individual differnet aspects life like sport play higher level develop talent get best example famous tennis table player town said interview improved talent played older brother working hard training sessions reach higher level standard brother plays order beat win games competetion brother lift skills strenthgen mentality secondly competitions may create good atmosphere healthy climate children improve thier abilitie study example daughter friends class struggling studying math math teacher found way make math interesting students teacher announced competition every day end lesson writes equations board gives prizes students solve nowadays daughter enjoying solve math problems furthermore competitions improve people career increase company outcome managers tend encourage competitiveness employers benefits company workers well conclude competitiveness enables people improve talents students love study also employers develop skills result societies get benefits trend

It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.",,,,,,7.5,bar chart sheds light employment rates gender changed 1995 2005 six nations australia switzerland iceland britain new zealand united states overall mainly two trends suggested diagram first employment rates males higher females 1995 2005 across six countries second period witnessed increase employment rates genders countries shown graph large gender gap employment took place iceland australia new zealand difference employment percentage males females reached approximately 30 1995 countries difference 10 15 also apparent increase around 10 employment proportions appeared gender across nations especially australia percentage employed men rose 56 70 employed women went nearly 26 38
2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"Competitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals. This essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency.
There are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people. The most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success. Such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results. Apart from that, another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition, especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard-earned victories. Such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction. Even if losing the competition, people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus, encourages them to work harder.
As far as I am concerned, I opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon, because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress, but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated.
To sum up, the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder, and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals. Personally, I hold that this is an auspicious trend.",,,,,,8.5,competitiveness desirable quality individuals essay analyse effects competitiveness people illuminate view whether eagerness competition represents auspicious ominous tendency mainly two types influence exerted competitiveness people prominent repercussion resides desire competition drives people work study diligently order stand rest achieve success diligence enables people accumulate sufficient experience helps improve capabilities obtain better results apart another important effect competitiveness competitors may seek considerable pleasure competition especially defeating competent rivals obtaining victories success makes people realise excellent gives tremendous satisfaction even losing competition people may still satisfied precious opportunity helps understand disadvantages thus encourages work harder far concerned opine competitiveness positive phenomenon helps people become industrious learners workers sufficient experience great potential making progress also makes daily lives enjoyable beating strong opponents may give unique sense satisfaction therefore think importance competitiveness never underestimated sum effects competitiveness manifested impetus driving people work study harder unique pleasure competing strong rivals personally hold auspicious trend

2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about competition. A number of people are of the opinion that competitiveness ought to be in a modern society. Personally, I assume that it is a great opportunity for people to develop their skills, relationships, imrove the level of knowledge and become a leader in different spheres. In this essay, I shall examine the way it has an influence on people and inderstand whether it is a beneficial quality.
Analyzing the impact of competitiveness, I agree that it helps people with trying to give all the best and not let another person to win. Moreover, if there were no competitiveness at my school, I would not try to do various projects or developing my skills to be an excellent student. This quality helps me always raise the bar even more. Also, I know that many famous brends such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci compete with each other all the time to take a leadership position in a fashion world.
As for being positive or negative, I am of the opinion that competitiveness is a positive trend due to numerous reasons. First of all, analyzing sports competition, I understand that it is a social process, depending on the biological and social changes that all people are going through. Secondly, in an age of social media and growing individualism, time spent interacting and communicating with others is reducing. However, our ability to work with others to achieve a common goal is an essential skill to develop, not only in sport but in life.

Sadly, the tendency of gender discrimination in the latter case has not changed between 1995 and 2005, while the mean employment rates have been continuously increasing.
Firstly, more gender-equal countries are Switzerland, UK and USA. The percentages for employment in 1995 for males are 65% in Switzerland, 55% in UK and 59% in USA. Similarly, those of females are 56%, 51% and 46%, respectively. After a decade, all of these numbers increased by 10% on average.

2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.
Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.
Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.
Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns.

In general, the high-income group spent much money on hamburger foods which occupy the highest sales on fast foods in the U.K, by 45 pounds per week. Whereas the lowest expenditure on fast foods is pizza approximately 6 pounds a week. In the volume of consumption, there is a rapid rise on fish & chips sales over the period contrary to a continuous reduction on pizza spending in the decades.
To start with the fast-food spending, hamburgers is the highest sales of fast foods per week in the U.K. In the high and average incomes classes, the amount of hamburger sales are the top one in their spending on fast foods, 45 pounds and around 32 pounds a week respectively. Fish & chips spending in the high-income group hits around 16 pounds a week, compared with the spending on pizza almost 19 pounds a week. This is followed by average income classes whose weekly expenditures on fish & chips and pizza are 25 pounds and around 12 pounds individually. Conversely, those with lower income spend much on fish & chips approximately 16 pound a week which is the top one of their fast food costs, compared with hamburgers and pizza which are around 14 pounds and 6 pounds a week.
Going into more detail with regard to the fast-food consumption in gram, there was not significate increase on fish & chips spending in the start of the period. They were a slight rise on its consumption from around 100 grams in 1970 to 150 grams in 1980, followed by a surge in 1985 by 300 grams and a further jump of 200 grams in 1990. The consumption on hamburgers had the same trend with fish & chips over the period. In the beginning, there was a slow upward on purchasing of hamburgers between 1970 and 1985 from around 30 grams to 100 grams. Then, a sharp increase in the consumption of hamburgers was 300 grams in 1990.

2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?","Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?
Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.
The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.
My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.",,,,,,6.5,many metropolises facing challenges including traffic gams serious lacking housing available families live particular developed countries governments looking way lessen volume traffic cities increase number housing provision metropolises people advocate businesses including large corporations factories along employees moving suburbs best way figure metropolitan problems sheer solution challenges faced cities economy boom country accompanied number problems incurred cities due multitudes living wonder metropolises represent job opportunities available better education system next generations strong pull factors appealing people stay cities despite higher cost living larger number populations cities result severe shortage housing higher demand housing available supply also bring higher volume traffic across cities particular peak hour thousand one employees commuting work students going schools people believe working location shifting rural areas solution enables lessen frequent usage roads cities simultaneously assumed housing issue solved naturally arising migration employees suburban town next working place business allocated suburbs alone rarely considered enough tackle problems place live requires basic facilities serve clothing food housing transportation basic needs human working place residential area suburban town without infrastructures people choice drive vehicles back forth cities living places general consumption consequence traffic congestion cities worsen combining significant deterioration air quality countryside due increase emission greenhouse gases therefore governments play key role establish neighborhood could communities outside larger metropolitan areas may feasible effective way minimize metropolitan issues view shifting strategies suburbs help lessen challenges faced metropolises governments take smart planning consideration employment bases living infrastructures developed suburban town

Traffic and housing problems has been a major problem in big cities due to the increasing population in these areas.The main contribution to the rapidly growing population are the multinational companies and the industries that have been set in the cities.These companies have a thousands of employees.As a result,if these companies are established in cities,it will lead to lot of traffic.For example,mumbai,a major city in India has uncontrollable traffic due to the vast IT sector present there.It has been very difficult for the people living in mumbai to travel even the shortest distances as it takes a lot of time to move from one place to another.The demand for housing also increases due to large number of employees from industries and huge companies which inturn leads to drastic increase in the expenses for housing.As a result,they have to compromise for small houses due to high rents.
The only solution for this problem is by mobilising the big companies and industries to countryside which has a lot of empty lands.By taking this step,it is both benefitial to the companies as well as the employees.The cost of establishment of the companies will be significantly low in the outskirts of the cities and the rural areas compared to the city.The employees also save a lot of time due to relatively less traffic and they also benefit to a large extent by low housing exenses.The traffic, housing problems and the pollution in the cities will also be reduced by taking this initiative.

2,"Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.
First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.
However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teams
have more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. On the other hand, others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. This essay will discuss both views and my opinion.
Some people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. When they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. In addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. As prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. There is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.
Contemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. Most offenders lack moral value. Furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. Therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. Society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.
I agree more with the second view. Obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. However, punishment should not be a priority. Education is important. Community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. There is a statistics of crimes rates in the United States of America which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.
Firstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.
However, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.
In addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.

On the whole, it is clear that there are different perform functions, sizes and weight between these two type of mobile phone. Actually, the contemporary mobile phone is more advanced than the other.
Looking more closely in the illustration, one can see that both of them is designed a ear phone on top of the phone as well as a keyboard which are setted under the screen. However, the screen of the former is displayed with black and white, the latter is displayed with full-colour. Moreover, the contemporary mobile phone is setted within different kind of functions such as camera with video capability, e-mail internet music player, multi-player game facility, while the early one is designed without such a series of functions which only has a function select button on the middle of the phone.
Furthermore, it is apparent that the size of these phones are different too. According to the illustration, the early one is bigger than the contemporary one, respresenting the former is 130mm and 50mm, and the latter is 90mm and 40mm which can be folded.

2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.
Firstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.
On the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.
To summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out. It is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country.",,,,,,6.5,nowadays due increasing crime rate people tend think best way decline crime giving longer prison sentences however criticisms probably believe much better ways decrease crime opinion true extent statement means prison sentences may necessary perfer ways education detenion center rather prison sentences especially minors firstly possible said increasing punishment would decline crime society considering fact citizens afraid lose freedom longer time given circumstance hong kong goverment established policy force people scan qr code leave home safe app common initially without punishment yet announcing prison sentences amd fines hongkongers use app quite often probably means punlishment get attentive cautious hand seem likely another proper ways reduce crimes one example creat better education people particularly youngsters people could think efficient way develop nurture thier manner whole life example lot different kind extra curriculums consist talk polices icac students join teach form concept good citizen take responsibilities living hong kong perhaps show societal expectation rather arresting destroy future summarize different opinions statement even believe information set better model people help people reflect bad behaviour likewise goverment established lot punishment residents consisently may feel stress probably good long term development morden well international city country

However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.
An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.
Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals.

These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.
My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases.

2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Today, the advertising has become very powerfull thanks to the television and the internet. But is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates, than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society?
First of all, I think that usually in the one selected price range, all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste. This is indeed true, for example, for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in China regardless the brand, and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies.
However, if the one buys the goods of well known brand, he trusts the experience beneath this brand. This is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective. For instance, when choosing the car, you probably would firstly consider BMW or Mercedec. The reason why you know them is not only good advertising, but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years.
Moreover, I believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption. This implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising. From that the decreasing of the aggressive marketing follows, though the marketing still has cruical role. In fact its focus changes so that it will become more informative and less disturbing in the future.
In conclusion I want to disclose my own point of view. I do agree with the topic to the certain extent, though I am sure advertising is only a one reason of high sales, among many others and its influence will decrease with time.",,,,,,7.0,today advertising become powerfull thanks television internet true important terms sail rates goods actual requests society first think usually one selected price range products serving purpose less equal properties quality taste indeed true example many electronic devices produced nearby factories somewhere china regardless brand therefore sales depend marketing strategies however one buys goods well known brand trusts experience beneath brand kind assurance consumer gets excactly expects product defective instance choosing car probably would firstly consider bmw mercedec reason know good advertising also quality proved millions clients throughout years moreover believe modern society actually moves towards conscious consumption implies people becoming awared product manufactoring process ratheer advertising decreasing aggressive marketing follows though marketing still cruical role fact focus changes become informative less disturbing future conclusion want disclose point view agree topic certain extent though sure advertising one reason high sales among many others influence decrease time

2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.
However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.
In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods.

2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Based on some alledges, publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans' requirements. Although in my point of view, commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands. However, some other factors are uttered here.
One of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals. To enlighten, some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities, as, not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things. As a vivid case, Japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries, while other companies, such as American ones, have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels.
Furthermore, based on the alternations that have taken place in the world, like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle, both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts. For instance, individuals' usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade, due to the lack of time for cooking, hence the development of takeaways is eye-catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply.
On the other hand, whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms, it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge. To illustrate, the main role is played by second-to-none commuting systems for delivering divergent products, therefore without their assistance, introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices.
To conclude, while publicity, nowadays, is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets, to me, it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things. Nevertheless, other justifications that are associated with the appeal of various merchandise, namely their quality, should not be ignored.",,,,,,5.0,based alledges publicity main reason high rate selling humans requirements although point view commercials impressive realms people looking address demands however factors uttered one highlighted contributors high quality accepted brands among rivals enlighten domestic brands even supported public similarly authorities never compete abroad commodities real quality terms price also attain level among imported things vivid case japanese cars utilized majority countries companies american ones lost attraction owing high rate consumption fossil fuels furthermore based alternations taken place world like either increasing population change lifestyle type well number substances used utilized undergone drastic shifts instance individuals usage fast foods skyrocketed last decade due lack time cooking hence development takeaways number customers swelled sharply hand whereas advertising effective international firms would feasible improvement transportation emerge illustrate main role played commuting systems delivering divergent products therefore without assistance introducing goods parts universe seems meaningless society access choices conclude publicity nowadays exploited means enhancing chance selling different markets impossible become prosperous folks need things nevertheless justifications associated appeal various merchandise namely quality ignored

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,"The table indicates the annual income of secondary/ high school teachers and comparisons in 2009. Overall, it can be seen an increase from starting year and after 15 years in all countries.
To go into detail, there are two countries, in Australia, and Denmark where teachers' annual income reached the maximum salary within 10 years. Specifically, The annual income started at 28,000, 45,000 in Australia, and Denmark respectively. Afterwards, the salaries reached 48,000, 54,000 within 9 years, and 8 years in Australia and Denmark.
When it comes to other three countries, Luxembourg, Japan, and Korea, those three countries teachers steadily increased their annual income, however, they kept working after 15 years and reach maximum later. In Japan, and Korea, their annual income gradually increase the longer they worked. For example, the first years' annual income in each country is 34,000, 30,000 in Japan, and Korea respectively. After 15 years, their incomes soared to 65,000 and 48,000. As a result, their maximum income will reach the peak of 37 years, and 34 years in Japan, and Korea. The salary is 86,000, 64,000 in Japan, and Korea.
Interestingly, in Luxembourg, the annual saralies start at 80,000 and increased to 119,000 after 15 years. In contract, there is not so huge gap between after 15 years annual income and maximum.

2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, news reports on TV programs and news papers tend to focus on incidents and emergencies rather than positive developments. In Japan, because of this phenomenon, many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought. I disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments, including entertainment.
To go into detail, in Japan, once people turn on the TV in the morning. People face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. In addition, there are more than 5 channels on TV, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. The Japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. It might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.
In contrast, when it comes Japanese crime rate, and case. They reached a peak of 2014, and keep decreasing until now. The cases are not significant derrence, compared with a few dacase ago. In addition, almost Japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. In terms of the murder case, Japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017. This means that the more media reported the savage crimes, people misunderstand Japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago.
Finally, it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent. On the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to Japanese economic growth, and some Japanese athletes have been successful in MLB(major league baseball), and football. This news must be more fascinating for Japanese people to encourage their own national identity.
In conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue. But it might be more beneficial for people's minds to be positive. If some heavy incidents happened, the Japanese government should restrict TV companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter.",,,,,,6.5,recent years news reports tv programs news papers tend focus incidents emergencies rather positive developments japan phenomenon many people influenced country might dangerous thought disagree tendencies focus positive developments including entertainment go detail japan people turn tv morning people face often face news reports murder case murdered criminal background details addition 5 channels tv 5 channels broadcast incident time japanese government might take control media order agitate people keep attention safety might important extent necessarily good influence people mind required watch fierce negative incident every morning contrast comes japanese crime rate case reached peak 2014 keep decreasing cases significant derrence compared dacase ago addition almost japanese crimes tend petty crimes thefts frauds shop lifting terms murder case japan ranked 5th safest country among 160 countries means media reported savage crimes people misunderstand japanese society getting dangerous decades ago finally understandable report heavy incident extent hand also report positive attractive news tourism especially inbound sales figures increasing contributing japanese economic growth japanese athletes successful mlb major league baseball football news must fascinating japanese people encourage national identity conclusion issue might beneficial people minds positive heavy incidents happened japanese government restrict tv companies broadcasting one channel limit time shorter

It is notable from the table, that in Denmark one could reach maximum salary in only eight years, which is the lower value. For comparison: the highest value is 37 years in Japan.
Another feature is ratio between starting salary and maximum one. In all the considered countries this ratio exceeds one and a half (in Japan and Korea it is even greater than two), except Denmark, where it is approximately equal to 1.2.

2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?
Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).
Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.
On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.
Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.",,,,,,8.5,news reports media focus problems emergencies often positive events really harmful individuals society whole let us consider purpose media existence first suppose spread important information people may use lives problems usually important positive developments since fact things people aware first place example due covid international problem many people lost jobs notified rising pandemic though would prepared somehow save money cutting unnecessary expenses learn new profession forth moreover believe problems shall solved people concerned problems may tend face honor participate solving instance energy crisis huge problem important aware society individuals could try careful gas electricity end society benefit harmful hand negative impact bad news individuals sometimes sure considered psychological issues particular individuals rather problem today media system people fall despair news reports think could take advantage provided information minimize negative impact help humanity solve problems finally view stated tendency really harmful society may sometimes harmful individuals responsible

I argue, in agreement with some people, that this behaviur is extremely negative for both individuals and socienty in general.
The spred of news that are focused on the negative events are harmful to the individuals. Indeed, people who used to read newspapers or whatch the news on tv believe that all the things that happen in the world and should be recognised are negative. It follows that individuals are hopeless with respect to the era their are leaving and feel an intense regret. Despite their being interest in the problem of society, they will be persuated that nothing matter. The world, they believe, is almost ready for the distruction. People will feel not just the loss of hope but they will stop be propositive. For instance, when a person used to read everyday in the newspaper that the city in which he lives is corrupted and poor, he will feel that the place in which he lives just as dangerous and toxic. Instead, to present also a news, in the next page, in which is mention a positive news like that of a young citizien obtaining international recogniasement, then he will add to the negative emotions the hope. Hope is extremely central in our everyday phychological state.
The tendency of focusing on the negative happening also damage society. First of all, if all the citizien of a city feel bad because of the problems and emergency that characterise the city in which they live, then a big regret and fear will be shared by all the people and then all the society will lose active citizien that could have keep things better. Furthermore, a particular society in which the spread of negative news is overreacter will present itself as extremely risky. However, if the entire society (that of a country) is described just in negative terms, then the probability that people will try to go away from that country will be higher. This is for instance what is happenig in Italy. News reports everyday mention mafia, dissocupations and corruptions and the yougest are incliened to move away.

This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Our actions in Present time are product of the Past. It also concerns the Judge sphere. But sometimes laws and jury has no access to the information from defectant's background. Some peple - including lawyers - believe the accused person's past is very important. I completely argee with it and in this essay I will support my piont of view with some arguments.
Firstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison.
Secondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever!
Anothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement.
On the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime.
In conclusion, having no access to the accused person's past facts is a big problem.

Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour.

Therefore, some of them reward their employees, especially with money, for outstanding outcome by creating competitive work environment. Even though it can be effective for some staff, others may not feel the same. In this essay, I argue what extent of this rewarding system would work positively as well as if there are alternative solutions to help employees more productive at work?
Firstly, creating competitive work environment might encourage employees to work harder as they can get a reward such as money. However, exposing staff to this competitive situation frequently can weaken the unity of employees and cooperation with each other as a team. I believe that rewarding system for empolyees should be a yearly event to celebrate the end of the year.
Most of all, there are alternative ways to encourage staff to be more effective at work. Employers should plan a regular gathering for employees. For example, the company can organise sports events, dinner parties or tea breaks. This can help staff communicate each other as well as build a close relationship; which are neccessary for effective and creative work environment.
Overall, it is obvious that financial rewards can encourage employees work harder but frequent rewarding can weaken the unity of team at work place. In my opinion, the company should limit a reward system and find a wise solution to benefit employees' abilities by creating cooperative and positive work environment.",,,,,,6.5,many business employers try find way imporve performance staff therefore reward employees especially money outstanding outcome creating competitive work environment even though effective staff others may feel essay argue extent rewarding system would work positively well alternative solutions help employees productive work firstly creating competitive work environment might encourage employees work harder get reward money however exposing staff competitive situation frequently weaken unity employees cooperation team believe rewarding system empolyees yearly event celebrate end year alternative ways encourage staff effective work employers plan regular gathering employees example company organise sports events dinner parties tea breaks help staff communicate well build close relationship neccessary effective creative work environment overall obvious financial rewards encourage employees work harder frequent rewarding weaken unity team work place opinion company limit reward system find wise solution benefit employees abilities creating cooperative positive work environment

On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .
Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .
To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm .

However, there are many different ways is which employers can implement to increase theit employees satisfaction in the work environment. In this essay, I will discuss why money incetives can be beneficial, and mention different alternatives.
Rewarding employees with money is one of the best ways to guarantee employees retantion and prevent employees tunrover. This is because most people work to provide better life for them and their families, and extra money can help them achieve that. As a result, companies can increase their employees satisfaction and encourage them turn off job offers. For example, yearly bounses are one of the main incentives to encourage people to work harder. However, companies who do not pay enough bounses can loss many special employees.
While money is considerd as one of the main reasons why employees are satisfied, it can add extra expenses on the companies, which can affect their future success. Managers can use different ways to encourage employees to work harder by saying thank you or giving them extra day off after a long project, which can have a positive effect on the work quality. For instance, in some private companies in Saudi Arabia, managers usually reward their staff by giving them day off when there is an important football match or when the weather is great.
In conclusion, while money incentives can reduce employees turnover, not all companies have the ability to implement this soultion. However, a much cheaper incentives can be used to achieve the same results.",,,,,,5.5,doubt rewarding employees wirh extra money positive effects quality work however many different ways employers implement increase theit employees satisfaction work environment essay discuss money incetives beneficial mention different alternatives rewarding employees money one best ways guarantee employees retantion prevent employees tunrover people work provide better life families extra money help achieve result companies increase employees satisfaction encourage turn job offers example yearly bounses one main incentives encourage people work harder however companies pay enough bounses loss many special employees money considerd one main reasons employees satisfied add extra expenses companies affect future success managers use different ways encourage employees work harder saying thank giving extra day long project positive effect work quality instance private companies saudi arabia managers usually reward staff giving day important football match weather great conclusion money incentives reduce employees turnover companies ability implement soultion however much cheaper incentives used achieve results

In response to the fast-evolving business industry, white-colared people may need an extra motivation than just having their profile featured with a big company. To my firm believe, the practice of encouraging employess through incentives or bonus is an effective way of maintaining the quality of work as well as another way to show appreciation to the seniors.
To my knowledge, this stlyle of management has been practicing for more than a decade, from small to large enterprises. The development of target acheivement or goal getter tactic is no surprise. We cannot deny the fact that money plays the most important part of cycling the world's economic and, of course, our everyday life. Hence, the most effective and easiest way to get people' hand on work is no where around but an extra sum of incentives or bonus from the company's annual benefits.
This hit hard to my personal experience. I realised the essence of it when I worked in a telesale company. I was offered a relatively medium-to-low basic salary which could not even yeild me any allowance after living cost reduction. However, I was fortunate enough to have a monthly incentive which would be evaluated solely on my performance each month. The evaluation was fair to the extent that I feel appreciated for what I work for.
On the contrary, if there were not given any incentives and were offered with something else as a reward, i.g. a free trip to somewhere, a couple of coupon vouchers, or even a car or house, I would still be ungrateful compared with the extra money earned every month. The reason is simply because stable income is considered more reliable than any other tangible or intagible assets, in the perspective of an employee. On top of that, the incentives and bonus can be increased yearly or quaterly based on the company performance.
In summary, I would like to reiterate that I agree on rewarding the emplyees with incentives and bonuses. Due to the fact that they can be as tool to build a strong montivation among the employees and deliver the company's gratitude toward them in an appropriate way.",,,,,,5.0,recent years new companies born increase competitive stregth terms employment ever response business industry people may need extra motivation profile featured big company firm believe practice encouraging employess incentives bonus effective way maintaining quality work well another way show appreciation seniors knowledge stlyle management practicing decade small large enterprises development target acheivement goal getter tactic surprise deny fact money plays important part cycling world economic course everyday life hence effective easiest way get people hand work around extra sum incentives bonus company annual benefits hit hard personal experience realised essence worked telesale company offered relatively basic salary could even yeild allowance living cost reduction however fortunate enough monthly incentive would evaluated solely performance month evaluation fair extent feel appreciated work contrary given incentives offered something else reward free trip somewhere couple coupon vouchers even car house would still ungrateful compared extra money earned every month reason simply stable income considered reliable tangible intagible assets perspective employee top incentives bonus increased yearly quaterly based company performance summary would like reiterate agree rewarding emplyees incentives bonuses due fact tool build strong montivation among employees deliver company gratitude toward appropriate way

This essay will examine advantages and disadvantages for this type of management and consider different methods to encourage people to work hard.
First of all, I strongly believe that when business practise recognised employers work with a financial reward the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this action. Despite the fact that only a partial amount of employees receive it, this has a positive impact among people that get the bonus, because their hard work is recognised, but also stimulates other to commit more for the company in order to achieve the same recognition. As a result, this management system is beneficial among all the employers. However, I think that this is not the only way to encourage people to work hard. In addition to the economic support, companies can improve the employees performance allowing flexible time or with additional time off. For instance, in my office when we work in for a deadline to issue a project, the directors always allow people that have been involved in the project to get free time. Despite, we work really hard the idea of getting holiday bonus encourage people to work as much as they can and they are aware that all this effort will be recognised.
In conclusion, I believe that financial rewards is a strong and effective method of management and has positive impact for all the employers,.

2,Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is often argued, that when employers pay a bonus to the people who work for them as a recognition for their commitment to the company this action can be an incentive for the people involved, while for others have an opposite effect. This essay will examine advantages and disadvantages for this type of management and consider different methods to encourage people to work hard.
First of all, I strongly believe that when business practise recognised employers work with a financial reward the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this action. Despite the fact that only a partial amount of employees receive it, this has a positive impact among people that get the bonus, because their hard work is recognised, but also stimulates other to commit more for the company in order to achieve the same recognition. As a result, this management system is beneficial among all the employers. However, I think that this is not the only way to encourage people to work hard. In addition to the economic support, companies can improve the employees performance allowing flexible time or with additional time off. For instance, in my office when we work in for a deadline to issue a project, the directors always allow people that have been involved in the project to get free time. Despite, we work really hard the idea of getting holiday bonus encourage people to work as much as they can and they are aware that all this effort will be recognised.

These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.
In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.
Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.

Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success.
Firstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes.
On the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience.

I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.
It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.
On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.

Ask anyone who the fastest man on the planet is and anyone will mention ""Usain Bolt"". This is probably not wrong. However, Is it possible that a young man in a remote village in East Africa, who has never seen a car in his life and has been racing horses his whole life, could actually be faster than Usain Bolt? I believe so. The only issue is that Usain Bolt had a platform. In the same way there is probably some artistic genius somewhere, who doesn't have access to a plush gallery, who is creating breath-taking artwork. But alas, who is there to judge the mastery of his piece?

Commuting from home to work, shopping and going to school from place to place account for a higher sheer volume of traffic in the cities that is causing a thousand hundreds of problems, consisting of traffic jams and air pollution. Some people believe there is an enormous improvement in road traffic if the travelling needs for people across the cities are deducted. The governments play a vital role to figure out this issues.
There is no doubt that cities have spread out over larger expanses of land as builders have construced wide expressways and ample parking to accomodate motor vehicles. This tempts a large surge in car use and public transit use has fallen. A case in point is Los Angeles where traffic jams are a part of living. According to a survey in 2016, Los Angeles drivers spent an average of 104 peak drive-time hours fighting slow traffic. Michael G McNally, a professor at the University of California claimed that the poor public transit services was one key of factors in the congestion incident on the road of Los Angeles. This forces people to drive their cars to travel from place to place as there is no option to be chosen.
However, improving public transport facilities alone is rarely considered enough to cope with the high volume in usage of the road traffic as the demand is still there. In recent years, the number of suburban hypermarkets ballooned in the cities, particularly in the developed countries, due to the high land cost in metropoils. Thereby, the amount of road traffic is sharply escalated in cities since people can drive their cars from home town to suburban or their destination. LA had an estimated 7.8 million registrations in population of 10 million in 2016 when New york just had 3.6 million registrations in population of 8.5 million. Car owners accounted for nearly 80% of population in L.A. This is highly likely that the car ownership is an vital reason for the busy road traffic. Reduction in numbers of car ownership is definitly one solution in the traffic congestion. By adopting policies to increase the car registration fee and to rise the parking cost, government can take one important step towards solving this problems.
My own view is that the travelling needs from place to place continuously increase in line with the development of metropolis. The high cost of parking and car registration fee combined with the 24-hour public transit system in cities can effectively limit the number of car ownership. This is a direct impact on the volume of road traffic over the cities.",,,,,,7.0,past decades rapid increase use road traffic cities world cities sprawl cars become essential transit bicycling walking become less practical commuting home work shopping going school place place account higher sheer volume traffic cities causing thousand hundreds problems consisting traffic jams air pollution people believe enormous improvement road traffic travelling needs people across cities deducted governments play vital role figure issues doubt cities spread larger expanses land builders construced wide expressways ample parking accomodate motor vehicles tempts large surge car use public transit use fallen case point los angeles traffic jams part living according survey 2016 los angeles drivers spent average 104 peak hours fighting slow traffic michael g mcnally professor university california claimed poor public transit services one key factors congestion incident road los angeles forces people drive cars travel place place option chosen however improving public transport facilities alone rarely considered enough cope high volume usage road traffic demand still recent years number suburban hypermarkets ballooned cities particularly developed countries due high land cost metropoils thereby amount road traffic sharply escalated cities since people drive cars home town suburban destination la estimated million registrations population 10 million 2016 new york million registrations population million car owners accounted nearly 80 population highly likely car ownership vital reason busy road traffic reduction numbers car ownership definitly one solution traffic congestion adopting policies increase car registration fee rise parking cost government take one important step towards solving problems view travelling needs place place continuously increase line development metropolis high cost parking car registration fee combined public transit system cities effectively limit number car ownership direct impact volume road traffic cities

The same thing is with the U.S. consumption, for example in 2000 the U.S. consumption was approximately 77 quadrillin compared to 1975 which was 54. we can see also in the past the gap between the consumption and production was not that big with time the difference became bigger. If we are comparing the U.S consumption versus the U.S production we can see that the consumption was higher than the production. In 2025 we expect the same trend but with bigger gap between the U.S consumption and production.",,,,,,5.5,graph see relationship energy unit axis versus year x axis see graph energy consumption increasing time similar way also energy production also increasing example year 2000 production nearly 74 quadrillion unit 1975 production nearly 52 quadrillin unit thing consumption example 2000 consumption approximately 77 quadrillin compared 1975 see also past gap consumption production big time difference became bigger comparing consumption versus production see consumption higher production 2025 expect trend bigger gap consumption production

With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :
1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.
2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.
3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.
4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.
5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.
6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.
7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.
As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home.

As a results any major city in the world is experiencing very dense traffic.This trend is now also being noticed in smaller cities too.
In order to reduce the amount of traffic, people should reduce their travel to work, education and shopping. At work that could mean working from home whenever it is possible, limitate the domestic and international business trip when not absolutely needed. Online studying could be generalized when the fied of study does not requires physical practice nor specific facilities. Since online shopping is becoming trendy we could change our habits and go on the web rather than in malls or in town in order to shop. The movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19, especially during the lockdown demonstrated that this is possible. However, during that period, most of us realized that this lack of mobility and travel freedom is not the best and is a heavy constraint, both personal and profesional.
Shouldn't we look for other alternatives in order to reduce the traffic ?
It is now well known buy all that using the public transportations is a great way to reduce the traffic. It is usually faster than using a private car and it is more eco-friendly. Even if it also has disadvantages such as the lack of timetable flexibilty, the lack of privacy, sometimes the price... it should be our prefered way of transportation whenever possible.
Carpooling is another great way to reduce traffic. Wether it is for daily trips to work or week-end escapades, that is a great way to contribute to a limitate the numbers of vehicules on the road. Maybie governments should find incitative measures such as the one on some U.S highways, where carpools have access to express lanes while the private drivers who are alone in their cars have more restrictions.
Even if our society is evoluting towards a very internet connected world where you can work, study and shop remotely, I think people might limitate their movement but won't stop travelling, whether it is long or short distance.
Instead of keeping selling millions ( or maybie trillions of cars every year on earth ) government as well as individuals should rather rethink the way they move and transport themselves.",,,,,,6.0,worldwide population constantly increasing globalisation implies concentrate cities travel work leisure education results major city world experiencing dense trend also noticed smaller cities order reduce amount traffic people reduce travel work education shopping work could mean working home whenever possible limitate domestic international business trip absolutely needed online studying could generalized fied study requires physical practice specific facilities since online shopping becoming trendy could change habits go web rather malls town order shop movement restrictions imposed especially lockdown demonstrated possible however period us realized lack mobility travel freedom best heavy constraint personal profesional look alternatives order reduce traffic well known buy using public transportations great way reduce traffic usually faster using private car even also disadvantages lack timetable flexibilty lack privacy sometimes price prefered way transportation whenever possible carpooling another great way reduce traffic wether daily trips work escapades great way contribute limitate numbers vehicules road maybie governments find incitative measures one highways carpools access express lanes private drivers alone cars restrictions even society evoluting towards internet connected world work study shop remotely think people might limitate movement wo stop travelling whether long short distance instead keeping selling millions maybie trillions cars every year earth government well individuals rather rethink way move transport

2,Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.
To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.
Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.
In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.",,,,,,6.0,modern times younger generation appear powerful influencial compared generations times past believe result younger people ascertive stepping question change existing societal norms archaic cultures first may negatively affect relationship older generation result unfamiliar changes subsequently tension bound resolve older generations come accept changes begin open truth young people days tend bold outspoken unlike predecessors better questioning norms sit right even going extra mile change norms cultures good example seen women empowerment rights activism part world years back believed woman place kitchen sole job birth rear children therefore women allowed educated paying jobs women older generation complied norm case modern times many young women opposed homes even headed women power activism many people older generation familiar young people outspoken understandable time taught follow rules question therefore fact young people become outspoken powerful foreign like every human nature whatever foreign different automatically hated result likely going tension 2 generations however constant advocation learning tension bound resolve example going back women rights activism start many older people board think normal however lot older people become activists conclusion believe power influence younger generation result ascertiveness effect changes societies even though may cause negative relationship older generation first subsequently differences likely ironed older generation learns accept changes

This is due to the mastery of using technology which overtake old people positions in many areas.
The young people in this era are able to take more advantages of using technology compared to the old generation, providing opportunities for innovation in an unconventional way and to increase income. For example, in the past, people were more engaged to TV programs and become passive consumers. However, because of the existance of YouTube, many young people can actively and creatively making contents such as cooking, music, or motivational videos and making it as a source of income. A YouTouber who have subscribers over than 30 million people such as Atta Hallilintar, for instance, has approximately more than 50.000 Euro income per month only by inviting people to watch his videos. Furthermore, by becoming a famous YouTuber, the person has a sigfinicant role as an influencer by showing his lifestyle, values, and even political views. He can also create new businesses such as food or clothing business, and it is easy to get into the market as followers will tend to be happily purchase items from their YouTube idol.
Due to the advancement on technology, many old people have difficulties of following such trend and thus, they are easily left behind. Many of them are still working on their conventional way by not taking benefit of technology. For example, an old man who has a clothing store cannot use social media for marketing his business resulting to only attract local people to buy his items. This issue has limited the old generation to compete with the young people in terms of source of income.

But it seems that it is changing in our modern world, young people now really have their word to say, are being heard and are influencing the whole society.
Internet and generalised use of social media has had a huge impact on how people communicate, especially for the young generation. While our generation grew up without acces to internet, asking for informations to our parents, teachers... young people have access to all kind of knowledge and datas on the web. They can forge their own opinions easily and expose their ideas to the entire world throught internet. Then they can share these ideas and discuss with people from everywhere in the community or in the world , their point of view are taken into account because their voices are being heard widely through internet.
Multinationals and marketing companies well understood that the young generation is the one giving the trend. They use all the data collected from the social networks to target the product that the youngest one are going to plebiscit. This underlines the fact that the taste and ideas of the young people are powerful and really are influencing the whole society in a large spectrum.
Sometimes, this is hard to accept for the oldest one who have been raised with a very diferent approach. In many countries, for a very long time, the oldest people, known as the one with the knowledge, were the one deciding, taking the decisions and showing the way. They were representing the authority and the power that very often young people would follow without questionning about the fact that things evolve and could be done in a very diferent way.
However, we can learn a lot from the young generations.

In my opinion, the benefits of music to both individuals and societies outweighs its detremental effects. In this essay, however, I will discuss both points of views.
To start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. For example, the effect that the current world wide sensation Korean boy band, BTS, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. Many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. Definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. Furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.
Moving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. The first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and It also creats job opportunities. To explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. Furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. This method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. Lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. Its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. For instance, very recently, the president of South Korea awarded BTS for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.

2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by some people that because nowadays people live longer than they used to, retirment age should be raised. In my opinion, I think that companies should use other measures to determine the right time for retirment.
In recent years, many companies have set rules for retirment age. This is because these companies believe that when people reach a certain age they do not performe as good as younger employees. As a result, many experianced employees lose their jobs, which can affect both employees and companies. For example, some companies require experianced employees to retire at the age of 60, which can lead to loss of valuable knowlege that can be used to train younger employees. To solve this problem, companies can use different measure to help them decide when to ask their emplpyees to retair or resign.
On the other hand, I believe that companies should focus on their employees performance and work quality, rather than their ages. The reason for this is that companies should retain well performing employees, which has nothing to do with age. For instance, companies can monitore their employees work quality as a way to meaure their ability to continue working. As a consequence, companies would have a stronger performance compared to other companies who use age as a measure, this is because they will have experianced and well performaing employees at the same time.

2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People nowadays are living much longer.
With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.
Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.
I don't agree with this idea.
Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.
Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?
If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.
The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?
The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.
The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.
Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.
What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?
I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.
I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Most of the citizens believe that, all countries should focus on producing more materials or items in their prime targets. Although some others think that, it is not a suitable target. I strongly agree with the idea of production and I will explain, why it is in this essay.
First of all, countries should have a strong economy to survive and meet their citizen’s expectations. And for the strong economy, they should produce new materials and do more researches to create new products and goods. So, governments should open new fabrics and research labs for the related sectors in order to create a big economy for their future. For example, they can give the opportunity to invent their own electronic vehicle in the country and this will allow everyone to buy it cheaper and easily instead of buying from other countries. Which is a best example of the importance of the new products.
On the other hand, some people believe that tourism and entertainment have big impact on the country’s economy. For example, even though Dubai is half desert nation, the government create a big tourism sector all over the world that everyone heard about the country’s name. Although, there are not any factories to produce materials or goods, but there are many entertainment actions such as Img world, legoland and many more inside the country. And these are working very well and taking attention of the other people for tourism purposes.
In conclusion, governments should give effort to produce and develop new products and goods for the country’s future. Although, they can also use the other opportunities to create a well economy for their people, such as tourism and the other sectors. But, in my opinion, they should have goals for more production and creation.",,,,,,6.5,citizens believe countries focus producing materials items prime targets although others think suitable target strongly agree idea production explain essay first countries strong economy survive meet citizen expectations strong economy produce new materials researches create new products goods governments open new fabrics research labs related sectors order create big economy future example give opportunity invent electronic vehicle country allow everyone buy cheaper easily instead buying countries best example importance new products hand people believe tourism entertainment big impact country economy example even though dubai half desert nation government create big tourism sector world everyone heard country name although factories produce materials goods many entertainment actions img world legoland many inside country working well taking attention people tourism purposes conclusion governments give effort produce develop new products goods country future although also use opportunities create well economy people tourism sectors opinion goals production creation

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Some think that the main objective of the countries should be the increment of production of materials and goods. I partially disagree that the constant increment in production is an appropiate goal becuase it has some negative consequences.
The idea of increasing constantly the production of materials and goods is based on the globalization process where each export and import goods and products, it is part of the globalise commerce. However, it is well-known that this practise represent negative aspects for the domestic economic and for the worldwide environment. For instance, in the free trade relationships between coutries, they negotiate the interchange of products, nontheless, in many times those trades produce a surplus or contrary a lack of products that increment the inflation or deflation of prices as a consequence of the invisible hand of Adams Smith that represent the offre and demand.
Addiotionally, the extraction of some natural resources such as gold, coal and crude are affecting drastically our planet. Consequences such as global warming, and huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are depleting the ozone layer. Therefore, these practices of production should be executed with the purpose of fullfil the needs of the society instead of make of this a profitable source. For instance, Natural resources should be only extracted to produce energy rather than consumed products such jewelry and so on. if we do not control our production of materials and goods, some natural disasters and social issues such as poverty and hunger will keep affecting human beings negatively.
In conclucion, although some people consider that each country should increment its production of raw materials and products as a main goal, I strongly believe that it is crucial to stablish a balance between this objective and others that affect our ecosystem and equity.",,,,,,5.5,think main objective countries increment production materials goods partially disagree constant increment production appropiate goal becuase negative consequences idea increasing constantly production materials goods based globalization process export import goods products part globalise commerce however practise represent negative aspects domestic economic worldwide environment instance free trade relationships coutries negotiate interchange products nontheless many times trades produce surplus contrary lack products increment inflation deflation prices consequence invisible hand adams smith represent offre demand addiotionally extraction natural resources gold coal crude affecting drastically planet consequences global warming huge amount carbon dioxide atmosphere depleting ozone layer therefore practices production executed purpose fullfil needs society instead make profitable source instance natural resources extracted produce energy rather consumed products jewelry control production materials goods natural disasters social issues poverty hunger keep affecting human beings negatively conclucion although people consider country increment production raw materials products main goal strongly believe crucial stablish balance objective others affect ecosystem equity

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.
To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.
Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.

It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.",,,,,,6.0,numerous experts think every country capable produce materials commodities agree argument brings benefits countries highlight begin manufacturing goods essential country helps build economy increasing production power assist export also makes less dependent countries instance china one largest producers world goods also makes largest exporter development production power contributes gross domestic product another reason extra produced goods used emergencies emergencies pandemics financial crises many growing production goods materials country always reliable business partner thus companies reach become loyal partners moreover countries aware increasing production example semiconductor chip crisis going world country world able meet demands chips contrary india planning satisfy demand chips strengthening manufacturing capacity massive level directly contribute economy also generate job opportunities conclude agree production necessary extremely crucial produce needed products order consistently outperform rest world also brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities rise gross domestic product country

Some people, in order to face this issue, assume that every country should aim at producing more materials and goods.
I do not concur with this statement.
Rather than increase the production of goods and materials, a country ought to sensibilize its citizens not to dismiss goods that are still able to function properly.
Getting rid of goods that still work just because the new one has been released forces every country to produce more and more good, leading to a worsening of our enviroment.
Another pivotal factor that I would like to underline is the fact that people from developed countries do not have a shortage of goods. Not at all.
Consumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions.
Most of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement. I firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars.
In my opinion, the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that I have briefly mentioned before: a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment.
Eath is already facing some very important issues when it comes to problems related to pollutions.

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively. Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.
Firstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.
Furthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.
On the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.

It cannot be denied that mass production on materials and products in a country presents a certain capability of their businesses and industries which have sufficient human and financial resources to develop the country's local economy. In other words, there is a higher rate of employment in the country. The income of governments is derived through tax levied in effect of the economic activities, such as value added taxes and income taxes. The funding from taxes can be used by the governments to fulfill the community's various concerns. This enables to gain the government's prestige from the public. As a consequence, it urges the governments to constantly intensify in the economic development resulting in an increase of their popularity.
An increasing production for materials and commodities alone is raraly considerd enough to reinforce the economic development of the country in the long run. The well educated manpower is an indispensable factor of the economy. The youth who are with the innovative mindset and worldwide view is a dynamic force of the economic development in the future. It is essential for the goverments to cultivate the younger people through higher-quality universal education and academic freedom, instead of focusing on the current and short term achievement.

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Nowadays, it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods. However, I personally believe there are more important things than the economy, which governments should pay more attention to. For example, health systems, education, fundamental rights etc. Despite this, in my opinion, production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well-being of the country, to make a balance among all objectives.
On the one hand, countries rely on the economy in order to make money, provide people with jobs and make a way of living. So I believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy. Nevertheless, constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country, as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials. Moreover, the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products.
On the other hand, taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing. Without health, education and values, most nations would not survive. I also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population, as people are the ones that work in production. In other words, both aims complement each other perfectly.

Overall, we can see that the machine has 2 different chambers: the first is into the sea and allows the water to entry, while the second has a turbine system moved by the air. Furthermore, in the second diagram we can see that the wave-energy machine could be located in two different positions.
In particular, there are two different input. From the top the air flow comes into the upper chamber and moves the turbines, that are connected with the electricity generator. At the same time, thanks to the sea waves, the water level rises and with the air flow move the turbines activating the generator.
In the second diagram, we can see that the two location options are related to the output of the produced energy. If the machine is located into the deep sea, large waves create an higher output than the one created from the smaller waves in the second location.

In my opinion, buying products such as books, clothes or air tickets on internet have a lot of advantages that could balance the disadvantages.
Firstly, one of the positive aspect is that online it is possible to compare the same product at different prices in order to chose the best deal. Furthermore, we have the possibility to buy in a faster way, without wasting time and finding the best article. Indeed, in local shops it isn't always possible to find what we are searching for, while in the large shopping centre the research of the right thing takes time and it isn't so easy.
Another advantage of shopping on the Internet is that in a single website, such as Amazon, you can find multiple types of product, from book to clothes or furniture. In this way you can buy different things without spending too much time moving from one place to another.
On the other hand, buying online could have some disasvantages. For example, on the shopping websites there are lots of spam messages that offer you products at special prices.

The number of university graduates is increased over the years. Specifically, the number of graduates students in 2007 is the doubled with respect with 1992. However, after a first increasment period between the 1992 and the 1996, the number of graduates goes down and it starts going up again in the first years of 2000.

Since the antiquity clothes showed the difference social status of people and now they are a way in which person can show her personal attitudes. It is difficult to valuate the role of clothing in work places. On the one hand, there are organisations that strongly believe that the employees must dress in a peculiar, smart way. On the other hand, there are work places in which how people who worked there are dressed does not matter.
Although I believe it is important to be dressed in the right way with respect with different social moments, I strongly insist that a person must not be judged because of her syle.
Organisations who require a particular dress code in the work place, are moved from the idea that the way in which you are dressed show your personality more than you can imagine. In particular, they believe that to ask people to be smartly dressed will present the organisation itself as serious and reliable. Moreover, in some work-place the heads insists in requiring a style that will not say a lot about the personal attitudes of the employees. Then, to have a particular skirt or to wear a fency pair of shoes will show up the particular attitudes of a person and this could be evaluated as a weakness by different managers. For instance, there are offices in which all the employees has to wear suit and tie if men and skirt and heel if they are women. However, sometimes this way of acting cause troubles and emotional deseases that can affect the employees who are not confidend in wearing clothes that respect that particular dress-code. One of the most famous case in Italy concered the flight company Alitalia who asked the woman empoyees to always wear the skirt. Just after several strikes they obtained the permit to wear also pants.
On the other hand, there are organisations in which how employees are dressed does not matter at all. They believe the skills possessed by the workers go beyond a particular pair of shoes. To take another example, the skills of an employee have nothing to do with the color of her hair. Places like this consider a point of streengh the emotional and personal attitudes of the workers as well as they strongly believe that to show personal attitudes in a work context can give a major value to the work itself. Then, they decide to leave free people to dress as they want without any restriction.
In conclusion, I believe that the tendency to rule the way in which people should be dressed in the work place must be operated with high awarness. the CEO of an agency can propose an office syle without compromise the particular attitudes and feelings of the employees.",,,,,,6.0,way dress always social relevance avoid since antiquity clothes showed difference social status people way person show personal attitudes difficult valuate role clothing work places one hand organisations strongly believe employees must dress peculiar smart way hand work places people worked dressed matter although believe important dressed right way respect different social moments strongly insist person must judged syle organisations require particular dress code work place moved idea way dressed show personality imagine particular believe ask people smartly dressed present organisation serious reliable moreover heads insists requiring style say lot personal attitudes employees particular skirt wear fency pair shoes show particular attitudes person could evaluated weakness different managers instance offices employees wear suit tie men skirt heel women however sometimes way acting cause troubles emotional deseases affect employees confidend wearing clothes respect particular one famous case italy concered flight company alitalia asked woman empoyees always wear skirt several strikes obtained permit wear also pants hand organisations employees dressed matter believe skills possessed workers go beyond particular pair shoes take another example skills employee nothing color hair places like consider point streengh emotional personal attitudes workers well strongly believe show personal attitudes work context give major value work decide leave free people dress want without restriction conclusion believe tendency rule way people dressed work place must operated high awarness ceo agency propose office syle without compromise particular attitudes feelings employees

Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.
To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.
In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.
To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance.

2,"Write about the following topic.Psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?","The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.
Colors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.
By contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. Their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment.
In conclusion, I believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers.

Information technology is one type that has already changed a lot from the past. Information technology influences our daily life in many areas, such as home, leisure, and work activities. It positively affects human life, but it also has its disadvantage. I will give my opinion about how information technology influences our lives and the information technology has more benefit or cause more detriment.
Information technology improves human life in many different areas. First, it reduces the difficulty of communication. The technology we have right now gives us a faster and easier way to communicate with other who is far from us. Right now, whether we use social media or email, we can contact the people who are far from us immediately. The second part is information gathering; right now, we can get news everywhere, just on electronics, such as cell phones and TV. Also, information technology helps humans in information storage and process. This is the advantage of information technology.
Information technology significantly improves human life, but it also has some disadvantages. The first thing is to reduce the time people commute together face by face. Nowadays, classes, meetings, and work can all go online. As a result, we have less chance to meet and communicate; this reduces the ability to watch others' behavior and expression to speculate their feeling and emotion. The second disadvantage is that convenient technology lets people rely on it too much and reduces our ability to finish jobs without technology.
In my opinion, the advantage of information technology has way more influence on human life than the disadvantages. First, it helps us solve our problems with more accessible and faster information. This meets the fast rhythm of life in this era. Also, information technology may let people rely on it, but this is very general for humans because we always use anything we can use to solve problems quicker and more efficiently. This is how information technology influences our life.",,,,,,7.0,improving technology tendency era right information technology one type already changed lot past information technology influences daily life many areas home leisure work activities positively affects human life also disadvantage give opinion information technology influences lives information technology benefit cause detriment information technology improves human life many different areas first reduces difficulty communication technology right gives us faster easier way communicate far us right whether use social media email contact people far us immediately second part information gathering right get news everywhere electronics cell phones tv also information technology helps humans information storage process advantage information technology information technology significantly improves human life also disadvantages first thing reduce time people commute together face face nowadays classes meetings work go online result less chance meet communicate reduces ability watch others behavior expression speculate feeling emotion second disadvantage convenient technology lets people rely much reduces ability finish jobs without technology opinion advantage information technology way influence human life disadvantages first helps us solve problems accessible faster information meets fast rhythm life era also information technology may let people rely general humans always use anything use solve problems quicker efficiently information technology influences life

However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.
On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.
On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.
As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question.

Given that technology changes many factors of our lives, I strongly believe that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages.
In terms of mobile phones bringing people closer together, these technological devices enable people to stay in touch no matter where they are. In the past, when people have to use telephones to contact with each other, is now replaced with social media, which is a convenient alternative for communication. For instance, smartphone applications such as email or WhatsApp, an instant messaging service, help people in different parts of the world interact with one another. Therefore, wireless communication networks facilitate communication and make people's lives easier and more convenient.
Regarding time efficiency, computers are an expendient way for people to find information instantly. Comparing to the past when people spends hours a day in a library to look for information using books, we can surf the Internet now. As an example. Wikipedia is an online, open-source encyclopedia that lets people browse for factual knowledge, and SCMP.com is a website which lets people catch up on the latest news. Conversely, if people carelessly use the Internet, they will result in discovering false messages, which readily mistaken their perspectives.

It is widely acknowledged that the internt can be a useful tool for learning. Taking advantage of the fast and variable resources and tools, many universities upload courses and materials in diverse fields of knowledge on the internet, so that any human anywhere can attend these courses and gain the information and expertise needed.

Furthermore, providing free online courses can contribute significantly to the society, by allowing students with low income families to be part of the educated community. Thus permitting more contribution to the world.

Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.
Prima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.
While remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.

In my opinion, this way of studing has both positive and negative aspects. This essay will argue why studing online can be unproductive for people.
The first reason why studing online is not good for a student is that is easier for him to lost the concentraiton during a lecture. For example, last year beacuse of the pandemic period, all students had to get class online, including me. It was a terrible year, because I stayed at home all the time and became very difficult listening lectures due to lot of things that capture my attention during lessons.
The other reason why getting class on the internet is a negative development is that the direct interaction between people is absent. I feel that this is the biggest drawback, because students are always alone in their room and they could become unsocial over the time. By contrast, the social life is important for everyone, because it help people to grow and share good and bad moment of the life. In addition, I think that is also important the dialoge with the teacher.
In conclusion, studing online can be a good solution for some people who need to stay at home and want to study at university, but in general it's a negative thing.

Secondly, we can as community reduce the effect of climte change on our enviroment by different ways. One of them is taking puplic transportion insted of using our own cars. In the matter of transportion, walking or using bicycles are the best for the climte because there is zero carbon monixide release. Moreover, replace the plastic bags with reusable ones will reduce the amount of waste.
In addition, goverments couled set rules and laws to control the amount of waste released in the enviroment. In Addition, planting more trees will have positive impact on the earth since they release more oxygen.

Everyone should reduce their greenhouse gases thanks to their actions as wasting less, taking more public transports or stopping overconsumption.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Global warming is affected by different things being agriculture,human activity ,technology and many more. some argue that instead of preventing it people should find means to survive along with it. I completely disagree and will state side of my view.
The reason why some people hold to this argument is because global warming is difficult to control. For example, there are no control measures on second hand cars bought in Botswana people end up buying old damaged cars. Consequently they end up emmiting smoke and have an impact to the climate. Other reason is, people they do not follow polices implemented by the government making it hard to prevent harm to climate. For instance, policy made in Botswana that people should get permits to cut trees but instead they do that without them. Above reasons are good enough to people to think that they
should find ways to live with global warming issues instead of preventing them.
Nethertheless, I beileve global warming can be preventable and cannot be accepted because it is harmful. It can damage our eco system. Reason being,people cutting treess will lead to less of them thus more carbon dioxide in the climate which is harmful to survival. Also it can lead to less rainfall being produced, resulting to less food being produced and no water. Therefore flora and fauna will suffer as well as human beings. Lastly due to climate change it can happen that the sun will burn plants in farms, that is less food produced then people will suffer. The government should put policies in place and make sure people abide by them to prevent global warming.
To conclude, though some people believe to find ways to survive with climate change I am against that as the damages caused by it are of more significance. Climate change needs to be prevented by all means as it is dangerous to eco system and government should find strict laws to save it.",,,,,,6.0,global warming affected different things agriculture human activity technology many argue instead preventing people find means survive along completely disagree state side view reason people hold argument global warming difficult control example control measures second hand cars bought botswana people end buying old damaged cars consequently end emmiting smoke impact climate reason people follow polices implemented government making hard prevent harm climate instance policy made botswana people get permits cut trees instead without reasons good enough people think find ways live global warming issues instead preventing nethertheless beileve global warming preventable accepted harmful damage eco system reason people cutting treess lead less thus carbon dioxide climate harmful survival also lead less rainfall produced resulting less food produced water therefore flora fauna suffer well human beings lastly due climate change happen sun burn plants farms less food produced people suffer government put policies place make sure people abide prevent global warming conclude though people believe find ways survive climate change damages caused significance climate change needs prevented means dangerous eco system government find strict laws save

There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.
Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate change

However, when we can see some household which have numerous jobs to keep the wolf from the door, it seems obvious that governments should impose restrictions on income.

In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.
For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,
it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.
Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.
However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.
In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.
Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that goverments should not allow salaries above a certain level because there are a lot of employees, such as workers and teachers that have a very small salary. In fact, they are the ones who works for the wealth and the future of the society and it is unfair that they are discourage. Moreover, I also believe that these kind of jobs are more stressful and challenging than others and they work as good as categories that have higher salaries.

It is seen that cycle starts when salmon lay eggs in the river and finishes when they return to river from the ocean to spawn.
The life cycle of salmon is initiated when a female lays eggs in the river and incubate them. Offsprings emerge from the eggs in a form of small fish form which are then reared in the freshwater before they enter the estuary. After a certain period of time, the fish change their habitation to estuary which is the entrance from river to ocean. Then, they completely inhabit the ocean environment, followed by a migration to rearing areas. These salmon, in this way, keep growing and eventually reach the point of maturation where sexual reproduction can take place between two opposite sex. Once mating occurs, they migrate back to the river area where the life cycle can be repeated for the next generation.",,,,,,5.5,flowchart given 8 stages life cycle salmon illustrated seen cycle starts salmon lay eggs river finishes return river ocean spawn life cycle salmon initiated female lays eggs river incubate offsprings emerge eggs form small fish form reared freshwater enter estuary certain period time fish change habitation estuary entrance river ocean completely inhabit ocean environment followed migration rearing areas salmon way keep growing eventually reach point maturation sexual reproduction take place two opposite sex mating occurs migrate back river area life cycle repeated next generation

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible.
Since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working.
In contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages.
All in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all.",,,,,,7.0,society becomes saturated technology traditional cultures losing roles society compatibility technology traditions often debated suggest possible whereas others argue essay discuss perspectives conclude saying almost impossible since people usually appreciate limited ways living challenging conventions technology usually choose one method another time instance company would focus using human labour advanced machineries produce product incompatibility may obvious first technology develops futher use machines increase employment decrease furthermore technology often considered convenient faster many people work done efficiently workers start abandon old ways living working contrast might possible two values work along society due different tastes various people traditional cultures usually appreciated old generation grandparents meanwhile new generation prefers technology life example grandparents read newspaper grandchildren watch tv play games family time moreover although hard company use time totally impossible number machines controlled production human labour machines work together maximise productivity covering disadvantages even though traditional values technology compatible theoratically indeed difficult compromise use two real life ergo people would beware risk losing traditional cultures

Overall, the whole process is made up by 2 stages, each composed of 4 steps, from the hatching of the eggs in a river, to the maturation in ocean and the migration to spawning area, again in a river.
To begin with, the adult salmon spawn, and after a period of incubation, the newborn salmons emerge and get together in a freshwater rearing. As they continue to grow the rearing head off estuary where another nurturing phase takes place.
Looking at the second stage, which occurs mainly in the ocean, it is noticeable that after the rearing stage in the estuary, the salmon’s flock undergo a further rearing step in an oceans area necessary to allow them to grow and maturing.

I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.
To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.
Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.
To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive.

As the reserach and development of human beings increases the birth of new technologies are inevitable. When a new technology is invented, mostly the new member of our living environment disrupts the traditional standards.
For example, prior to the internet era we used to communicate less through the mobile devices and tend to have face to face conversations. This is often true while considering a chat between our family members. On occasions like birthday, a festival season like Christmas we used to go in person to greet the loved ones. However, as technology evolved and traditional jobs are swept away people migrated to locations with more opportunities and often these are far from the native places. This situation along with the communication platforms built above internet like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat make us feel like we do not have to travel so far just to wish for a special occasion when we can do the same easily on a mobile device.
From the authors experience it is clearly understood that he traditional cultures are now covered by the clouds of new technologies which threatens the survival of many hunam beings.

That was all replaced with the invention of the first car, making it only a one-time investment for the drivers.
The negative side to this is that many centuries' old traditions that hold a high level of nostalgia for communites will one day disappear.

Some people argue that, they both can not go well each other on side and I completely agree with statement. In this essay, i will explain how technology affects a culture in a bad way.
Firstly, media has played important part in damaging to cultures in the world. Next to that, modern technology has more advancement in telecommunication department that turned the world into global village. Furthermore, whatever is available in one corner of the world can easily found in another one , so that, it is damaging the uniqueness of any area. People more prefer to eat western food compare to traditional hence, country's street market has also need to change in their favours and cuisine. More and more people in Asian countries, for example, are copying the styles of American outfits and street foods in India are widely replaced by KFC and Mcdonalds. Hence, media play a crucial role in culture to become less distinctive.
On controversy, while development in technology makes people life easier, it also changed the way we live. The introduction of new appliances like the microwave and electric grill has radically changed the traditional cooking. People no longer spend time in kitchen to make food for themselves as they were used to do before. In addition, development in travel and tourism can much affordable to travel in other countries and one can be easily explored the world by advance facilities. Everytime, when a tourist visits a country, they bring with it own culture and it leaves some impression on the local people. For example, a great number of people in India started wearing jeans after the development of tourist attraction in the area.

Firstly, such extreme sports should not be banned as they are also sport just like any other sport. furthermore, major sports like cricket are also not the safest to play as the ball is made of solid leather it can put crack on someone's head which is extremely dangerous. extreme sports are meant for enjoyment and they also help to release some stress.
Secondly, if such sports are conducted properly then it should not be as dangerous like there should be guidelines where they make sure that pieces of equipment are in excellent condition and where they do make sure a safety check.
Lastly, despite being extreme, many find themselves indulging in such activity because it helps them reduce their stress at work or home. The reason is that when we engage in sports, our body releases oxytocin, a hormone that alleviates stress and helps us feel more relaxed and peaceful unlike when we are bombarded with phone calls or emails from clients.

Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you.

In this essay, I will discuss two opposite attitudes of modern people to some traditional celebrations and give example and some advice to the issue.
On the one hand, it seems that the majority of people does not care about the reason of holidays, they are ready to enjoy them without any concrete reasons. First of all, that happens usually because of the fact that many people overwork and do not live in their work-life balance, so they are very glad to have additional day-off. The second explanation to the issue can be that people follow some traditions from ancient times, so some of those traditions became as a routines, that the basic meaning could be forgotten during the times. But nations continue folloving some customs just because they got used to them, even if they do not remember the main purpose of the celebration. The third reason to that can be that young generation do not understand some of their ancestors traditions, so they just accept some festivals from their predecessors as days when they are able to make their lives brighter and enjoy themselves.
On the other hand, there are exist people who know the basics of festivals and familiar with the hystory of traditions in their countries. Such kind of people usually consern about their traditions and pay more attantions to some specific atributes of festivals, which can be symbolise health, wealth, success, or maybe femily hapiness, et cetera. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the main purposes of some, especially ancient, traditions, to be explained to others. First of all, people would become familiar with some old customs and maybe partly could understand the reasons why their ancestors used some kind of colors and accesuars during that holidays. Additionally, people would know better the histories of their countries and share those knowledge with younger generations. So, the youth could not only enjoy themselves during celebrations, but also become more intelligent about traditions in their homelands.
To sum it up, it is widely spread attitude on holiday organisation as to only having entertainment, dancing, and having wonderful moods during those days. However, if the history of festivals and ancient traditions is spread properly, people become more wisdom about the main reasons of those celebrations in their countries.",,,,,,6.0,nowardays widely believed people forgotten main purpose traditions religious celebrations festival periods prefer enjoy fun holiday essay discuss two opposite attitudes modern people traditional celebrations give example advice issue one hand seems majority people care reason holidays ready enjoy without concrete reasons first happens usually fact many people overwork live balance glad additional second explanation issue people follow traditions ancient times traditions became routines basic meaning could forgotten times nations continue folloving customs got used even remember main purpose celebration third reason young generation understand ancestors traditions accept festivals predecessors days able make lives brighter enjoy hand exist people know basics festivals familiar hystory traditions countries kind people usually consern traditions pay attantions specific atributes festivals symbolise health wealth success maybe femily hapiness et cetera opinion would beneficial main purposes especially ancient traditions explained others first people would become familiar old customs maybe partly could understand reasons ancestors used kind colors accesuars holidays additionally people would know better histories countries share knowledge younger generations youth could enjoy celebrations also become intelligent traditions homelands sum widely spread attitude holiday organisation entertainment dancing wonderful moods days however history festivals ancient traditions spread properly people become wisdom main reasons celebrations countries

In Australia, we can see that in the year of 1995, the rate of males getting employed was more than that of females getting employed with males standing at 55% employment, and females on the other hand at only about 25-27% employment. In fact, it can be seen that the rate of employment for males in both the years, 1995 and 2005 is more than that of the females!
Resonating with the point made above, despite the slight increase in the rate of females getting employed, the males still towered the 2005 comparison in the rate of employment, standing at 69%, leaving the females at an slightly increased 39%.
In Switzerland on the other hand, although the rate of employment went to the males in both years of 1995 and 2005, there is only a slight difference between the rates. In the year of 1995, the rate of swiss men getting employed stood at 65% with females only being 8% behind, standing at about 58%. Meanwhile, in the year of 2005, the rate of swiss males employed shot up at a whopping 79%, leaving the females only 10% behind, at about 69%.
Actually, it can be seen that the rate of males being employed is more than females in all of the 6 countries of comparison! Just that the difference of the rates are very minimum in Switzerland in both the years and in UK in only the year of 1995.

A great example of this is in India during the nations' biggest festival, Diwali. Diwali is celebrated across the nation in the month of October for it was when Lord Rama, the greatest hero of our holy Hindu scriptures returned victorious from his battle in Lanka by defeating the demon king, Ravana. Traditionally, there used to be mass 'pujas' (worship ceremonies) held in every nook and corner of the nation, you could literally find and join a puja ceremony anywhere you went in India.
Although they are still held, the new generation of Indian youth proudly known as 'Gen-z', is starting to abandon the true meaning of this festival by mending it in their own way. Instead of spending money to call over the poor and homeless to their homes to give them a meal (like what was traditionally done), they are using all that money on partying and gambling in the 'name of Lord Ram and religion'. I personally find this utterly disgusting and disrespectful. Although it is a much more eco-friendly method of celebrating than bursting crackers, I feel that it is like you are spitting in the face of Lord Rama.
The case of India and Diwali is just one of the many ways people are abandoning festive traditions to just enjoy themselves and not give back to the society (like the purpose is in at least all Hindu festivals).
At the end of the day, it depends of which country and it's festival. If you look like a nation like China, their grandest festival, the Chinese New Year as depicted in the picture given below, has still not lost it's authenticity. They still hae the same traditons intact as they were when it was first ever celebrated thousands of years ago.

The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.
Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.
Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.
In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time.

I agree with that statement, however, I believe that other more essential proffesionals such as doctors, teachers, rescuers should be highly paid.
On the one hand, entertainers earn incredible sum of money which can be estimated much more times than ordinary people obtain. Thier salaries usually allow famous celebrities live very wealthy - they possess expensive properties, laxury cars, have vocations in the best resorts, which a person from another sphere hardly can afford. Of cause, it seems not a matter of the fact that they earn more money than others, but for some people that fact can be observed as unfairness, because the jobs of celebrities are not a rocket of science. However, this is a famous postulate that demand creates supply, that is why demanded professionals have higher earnings than others. For as long as people have possibilities and willingness to make their lives more brighter and interestings, they will pay for entertaining businesses. This is the main reason why entertainers usually wealthy and rich.
On the other hand, some proffesionals such as doctors, teacher, rescuers can be recognised like more important than entertainers, nevertheless they usually underpaid or their earnings can be even so little that it is hard to survive for them. I belive that those people play the more essential roles in the skill development, health improvements and safty of life in general. In my opinion, population should pay more attention to those kinds of proffesions. Additionally, governments should support financially such workers from vitaly important idustries. Moreover, those professionals are usually in demand, by that I mean they should be payed as demanded employees, such as entertainers, no less.
In conclusion, some professionals such as entertainers are paid extremely more money because they are in demand. However, some professionals, such as doctors, teachers, rescuers, usually underpaid.

Some people rised hot debate on this issue.
Some of them believe this high payment is wrong. They believe those stars or musicians didn't really improve our society too much. They did creat some arts for our spiritual world. However, those contributions are far behind scientists, politicians, doctors and so on. Sadly, we can not live on the songs, the films. Those arts are great, but they aren't great enough to creat a such big payment gap between other jobs. In my country, my teacher, basically a unknown scientist, only has 700 dollars per month. This is incredible low since famous singer have endless zero behind their payment account.
However, the other side of people think their payment is rightful and I am one of them.

That is the new rule of our society so there are nothing wrong. As for those scientists or doctors, some of us even can't remeber them before we need them.

In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.
People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.
Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.

1,"Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.","The diagram illustrates the acid level in the mouth obtained afrer the consuption of sugar and honey. The process of incresment of acidity (or low pH values) are subjected to a strong variation in the 40 minutes occurring after sweet foods are eaten. The risk that a tooth decay occurs is high mostly if you eat cane sugar.
Before eating sweet foods the level of pH is neutral. 5 minutes after sugar has been eaten, the situation is radically different. The level of pH plummet down, around 3,5 if you eat cane sugare. After 5 minutes the level of pH arrives at the maximum of the acidity level that can be caused by sugar. Then, the level of pH starts deacreasing slowly again and after 30 minutes (if cane sugar had been eaten) or a little bit less (20-25 minutes) if honey or fruit sugar had been eaten, the acidity is almost normal (between 6 and 7).
The risk that a tooth decay occurs are very high, mostly if the the sweet product eaten is cane sugar.

2,"Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Should cultural places be charged? This question opens a big debate. On the one hand, there are some museums that require an admission fee to be paid. On the other hand, there are free-entry museums. I believe that if the charge to be paid is not expensive then it is right and fair to require an admission payment to visit a culutural place.
In general, we used to believe that free is always better. However, I believe it is not a waste of money if they are spent to increase your knowledge. In Italy, for instance, museums and cultural places, in general, do not receive the economical support they need from the administrative centres. This phenomenon implies the following choice: either museums have to ask people to pay an entry fee or they have to stop taking care of the building and the artistic works they host. Then, I believe that to pay an admission fee is a way people, who are interested in art and in culture in general, can demonstrate their taking care of the place in which art is preserved.
What should be the negative consequence of asking for an entry fee? In general, we believe that the money we spend is wasted. Although we spend them to obtain something we appreciate a lot, we always have the tendency to think that money should not be used and preserved. I cannot disagree with this way of thinking. However, I believe that spending money to pay a trisfling amount of money to get access to a cultural place is not a waste. Rather, it is a sort of investment for your personal culture and for the cultural building itself. What's more, generally, if people have to spend money to do any activity they used to enjoy as they can. As good materialists, we want to live the experience to respect the money spent. Then, paying an entry fee will encourage people who care about art to visit a museum rather than those who do not care. Art maybe is made less accessible but, in my opinion, will be more respected. The entry fee should not be (and in general is not) expensive. I cannot see why it should be seen as a loss of money to pay the entry fee of 5 euros to go inside the Louvre in Paris, the estraordinary Valle dei Templi in Sicily, or the magnificent Uffizi gallery in Florence. I believe that money could not be spent in a better way than to visit these places.
In conclusion, I believe there are no real disadvantages caused by the payment of an entry fee, rather there are economic advantages that could help the administration of the museums in maintaining the quality of the service and preserving art works.",,,,,,7.0,cultural places charged question opens big debate one hand museums require admission fee paid hand museums believe charge paid expensive right fair require admission payment visit culutural place general used believe free always better however believe waste money spent increase knowledge italy instance museums cultural places general receive economical support need administrative centres phenomenon implies following choice either museums ask people pay entry fee stop taking care building artistic works host believe pay admission fee way people interested art culture general demonstrate taking care place art preserved negative consequence asking entry fee general believe money spend wasted although spend obtain something appreciate lot always tendency think money used preserved disagree way thinking however believe spending money pay trisfling amount money get access cultural place waste rather sort investment personal culture cultural building generally people spend money activity used enjoy good materialists want live experience respect money spent paying entry fee encourage people care art visit museum rather care art maybe made less accessible opinion respected entry fee general expensive see seen loss money pay entry fee 5 euros go inside louvre paris estraordinary valle dei templi sicily magnificent uffizi gallery florence believe money could spent better way visit places conclusion believe real disadvantages caused payment entry fee rather economic advantages could help administration museums maintaining quality service preserving art works

I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.
Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.
Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.

The higher acidity produced is, the lower pH value is shown. Fruit sugar, cane sugar and honey are selected in this analysis.
By and large, the lowest level of pH value between sweet foods is cane sugar, dropping to 3.5 points in the first 5 minutes after it is eaten. And its pH value stays at points below 5.5 at which tooth decay occurs, of 25 minutes' duration. Honey remains its pH level above 5.5 points except the first 15 minutes.

2,"Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most world-class museums are free in London, but some museums and art galleries around the world have an admission charges. Frankly speaking, museums with free entry do not mean no cost incurred in their operation. In contrary, there is a lot of maintenance expenditure on exhibits of museums, particularly on historical paintings and valuable statues. These costs are funded by the governments in order to provide the welfare to their civilians. Some people advocate all museums and art galleries should charge the entrance fees as the public funding have to be spent in dire need of foods and housing in the community. This essay attempts to find out its benefits against costs.
There is no doubt that thousand millions expenditure in the operating of museums are financed by the local governments. The UK government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds a year on supporting the cultural and artistic life of the country. Some people object to this expenditure, arguing that it is unfair to devote much tax payers' money to things which only appeal to a minority of people. They think these attractions should be self-funding, in other words, museums and galleries should set an entrance fee which cover their costs, besides, these costs are reflected via a realistic amount for tickets. The public funds saved could then be spent on more important matters such as housing or providing better educational facilities.
Nevertheless, the culture and arts are not a trivial matter but a vital part of a nation's identity. Not only the arts have a key educational role by representing the traditions and heritage of people, but also galleries and museums should be freely available to all, rich or poor. It is clear that this is basic welfare to all citizens in a country. From economic aspects, tourism can be drived by these attractions. A case in point is British museum, which appeals an endless influx of tourists from various parts of the world to visit every year. Therefore, they are responsible for a significant amount of employment.
My take on this is that the governments have a responsibility to support a range of cultural and artistic activities and to make the museums and galleries free available to all their civilians despite many demanding on their funding resources in the community.",,,,,,6.5,museums free london museums art galleries around world admission charges frankly speaking museums free entry mean cost incurred operation contrary lot maintenance expenditure exhibits museums particularly historical paintings valuable statues costs funded governments order provide welfare civilians people advocate museums art galleries charge entrance fees public funding spent dire need foods housing community essay attempts find benefits costs doubt thousand millions expenditure operating museums financed local governments uk government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds year supporting cultural artistic life country people object expenditure arguing unfair devote much tax payers money things appeal minority people think attractions words museums galleries set entrance fee cover costs besides costs reflected via realistic amount tickets public funds saved could spent important matters housing providing better educational facilities nevertheless culture arts trivial matter vital part nation identity arts key educational role representing traditions heritage people also galleries museums freely available rich poor clear basic welfare citizens country economic aspects tourism drived attractions case point british museum appeals endless influx tourists various parts world visit every year therefore responsible significant amount employment take governments responsibility support range cultural artistic activities make museums galleries free available civilians despite many demanding funding resources community

On the one hand, there is ample evidence that the admission charge for entry exhibitions is used for fixing and improving facilities. For example, Museum Siam in Thailand exhibiting in the old buildings in Bangkok city manages the admission fees for fixing the building and for caring toilet and parking facilities. However, this fee is just a small part of managing funds as the museum is supported by the Thai government, which responses to minister expenses.
On the other hand, some museums and art galleries in Thailand are free for Thais only, while the foreigners have to pay for entry. Since the exhibitions are fully taken care from governments for facilitating the visitors, this brings to a benefit for Thai citizens to explore the exhibitions without any loss of their money. Also, the exhibition aims to promote for foreigners rather than domestic people, leading to the charge rising to double of the normal price when high season.

Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Something that has been debated about a lot recently, people around the world have different views about to whom the design of newly constructed buildings should be controlled by. Today, I am here to discuss both sides of the matter and at the end will give my own view.
The people who believe the design of these buildings should be controlled by governments believe so, because they feel that the governments will design the buildings in a way that is not too flashy and nor to minimalistic. It has been seen may times that buildings built by constructing companies/ the financers turn out to be either very flashy or minimalistic. A great example of this is in India's capital, Delhi, where an originally planned office, had exteriors constructed in a very childish and jazzy manner. A thing to also keep in mind that this was the construction of a private office for the top lawyer in Delhi, Arun Deshmukh. He handed over the design of his office to the constructors feeling they won't do anything immature. 4 years later, however, when he went to see the final result of his much-awaited private office, he was completey bewildered by the sight. Instead of seeing a normal office-like building with normal cement on it's exterior, he saw that his dream office looked the exterior of a night club! Instead of normal cement, the exterior was built with transparent glass, and Mr. Deshmukh's name and designation, written in a florescent like way, was carved out on a 3 metre long glass slab!!
Coming to the people who believe the control of the design should go to the constructors/people who finance the building think so because they feel that not everything should be in the hands of the government. They also feel that since it was their initiative to get that building built, they should have the final say on how it should look like.
When it comes to my opinion, i believe that the control of the design of the building should go to the person/people who first thought of getting it constructed, meaning the people hired architects and did the needful to get an ideal design of the building they want to construct.",,,,,,6.5,something debated lot recently people around world different views design newly constructed buildings controlled today discuss sides matter end give view people believe design buildings controlled governments believe feel governments design buildings way flashy minimalistic seen may times buildings built constructing financers turn either flashy minimalistic great example india capital delhi originally planned office exteriors constructed childish jazzy manner thing also keep mind construction private office top lawyer delhi arun deshmukh handed design office constructors feeling wo anything immature 4 years later however went see final result private office completey bewildered sight instead seeing normal building normal cement exterior saw dream office looked exterior night club instead normal cement exterior built transparent glass deshmukh name designation written florescent like way carved 3 metre long glass slab coming people believe control design go finance building think feel everything hands government also feel since initiative get building built final say look like comes opinion believe control design building go first thought getting constructed meaning people hired architects needful get ideal design building want construct

I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.
To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.
On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country.

In general, women work far more on unpaid work such as gardening and childcare compared to men and even more if they have more children.
In the household where there are no children, women spend 30 hours when men spend around 20 hours a week doing housekeeping. It is clearly evident that women spend the least doing housework when they have no children compared to those who have at least one.
When a family has one to two children, the quantity of time women devote on unpaid work dramatically increases to little more than 50 hours. On the contrary, the amount of time men put in to help their wives remain the same even when they get children.
Finally, women spend the most time at 60 hours doing family work when there are three or more children.

This concept triggered some people to start thinking that there oughts to be strict regulations on how much noise each individual can make in order to minimise the harmful effect on other people. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the regulations and suggest whether it is beneficial or not after all.
One of the advantages if strict laws are applied is that it is the easiest and most effective way of solving the problem in a short term. The noise level of human population will significantly drop as being loud becomes an illegal action to carry out. For instacne, even imposing a fine due to excessive sound one made can strongly discourage him or her from making loud noises ever again. Furthermore, people's standard of living will most likely to be enhanced as there are less disturbance caused by noise. People will be able to enjoy quiet, relaxing weekends even in central cities, for example.
In contrast to the preceding positive outcomes, there are disadvantages due to the strict laws such as too much restrictions on people. The laws can be considered as rather aggressive and coercive since people's some daily life routines may get spoiled. Some hobbies like singing and even special cases like emergency situations will confront some problems if such laws become real. Moreover, it is almost impractical to set up the standard of 'loud' noise or even measuring the decibels individulas make all the time. Society would get rather intensive and monotonous once the laws controlling the sound level are implemented.
In summary, despite the efficient aspects of the laws, it is more important to acknowledge the negative sides such as stress individuals suffer from strict regulations or damages on their lifestyle.

This issue has raised some concern whether proper legislations must be implemented or not. In this essay, the positive side as well as the drawbacks of noise will be discussed and the reason why I think that it is better for our leaders to take action regarding this matter will be explained.
Noise can give the community awareness and enjoyment. Noise can help people know what is going on in their area. For example, during thee COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, it is mandatory for the local government to sound sirens and alarms for the city to know that the curfew has began, leading to people's awareness that they should be at their homes in time. In terms of enjoyment, a substantial amount of noise can make one enjoy his free time, such that his leisure activity is related to music. Instrumentalists need time to practice their skills for them to excel in this field. If laws regarding to noise will be implemented, their practice will be controlled in such a way that this will not be available on their ends.
On the other hand, one considers noise as a pollution that can cause detrimental effects in the society, resulting for an aim to reduce it by the help of the government. Noise can give a person distractions not only in his rest, but also in his work. Work form home is becoming ubiquitous nowadays. Once noise is uncontrolled, there is a tendency that distractions occur, which cause poor career performance. Also, sufficient rest is an essential commodity for the body and brain to recharge after long shifts of work. Noise can hinder one to attain this, leading to health problems, such as brain and physical fatigue. Hence, laws must be implemented by the authority to prevent the drawbacks that it can bring to an individual.
In conclusion, noise is beneficial to some for it brings an increase in awareness and enjoyment in leisure activities, however, one ought to consider the health risks it inflicts and its negative effects to one's work performance.

On the other hand, married women spend more hours than their spouses, and this period seems to increase proportionately with the number of children in the family.
As is shown by the chart, married women without children attribute 30 hours on average every week for unpaid work. Compared to childless married women, women with one or two children spend around 50 weekly hours on average in those activities. Turning to women with more than two kids, they have the most time spent on unpaid house work, with 60 hours per week.
Overall, this gender related trend can be related to the traditional premise that women ought to pursue most of the work at home while men are supposed to work outside earning money for their mutual survivorship.",,,,,,8.0,given bar chart presents many hours weekly spend married females males kinds work include childcare home housework gardening forms activities clear chart married males spend constantly 20 weekly hours average unpaid work regardless number children hand married women spend hours spouses period seems increase proportionately number children family shown chart married women without children attribute 30 hours average every week unpaid work compared childless married women women one two children spend around 50 weekly hours average activities turning women two kids time spent unpaid house work 60 hours per week overall gender related trend related traditional premise women ought pursue work home men supposed work outside earning money mutual survivorship
2,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, there have been several laws to control the noise made by neighbors and surrounded places close to people's accommodations. Some people think that these laws should be strict and effectively enforced by authorities in order to avoid any small noise that might disturb the private comfortability. Others believe that such laws might entail a few disadvantages and negative repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to count possible advantages and disadvantages of this legislation.
It is well known that home is the ideal place to rest, relax and bring positive energies to the residents. Thus, noise made by the neighbors might threat these unique blessings we are used to enjoying in our houses. Moreover, many people perform vital actions within their homes that require silence and high concentration, such as studying, reading and other forms of creative activities. Therefore, governments' duty is to guarantee that these activities are performed without any disturbance, by making specific laws to control the amount of noise and ensure optimal quality of life for all the citizens. In addition, if there were not laws to control the noise, we would encounter many more fights and inconvenient incidents among neighbors.
On the other hand, there is another aspect to be considered. Calling for strict laws and total preventing of any sounds produced by adjacent people could sounds unacceptable. People still have the basic right to arrange meetings and parties at their homes, and others need to listen to music as a vital action for their soul and wellbeing.
To conclude, in order to find the balance between the advantages and the disadvantages, governments might design flexible laws to meet the people's needs. For example, in some cities, noise preventing is valid only in specific periods of the day, periods in which most of the people supposed to rest and need silence.",,,,,,7.0,recently several laws control noise made neighbors surrounded places close people accommodations people think laws strict effectively enforced authorities order avoid small noise might disturb private comfortability others believe laws might entail disadvantages negative repercussions people lives essay trying count possible advantages disadvantages legislation well known home ideal place rest relax bring positive energies residents thus noise made neighbors might threat unique blessings used enjoying houses moreover many people perform vital actions within homes require silence high concentration studying reading forms creative activities therefore governments duty guarantee activities performed without disturbance making specific laws control amount noise ensure optimal quality life citizens addition laws control noise would encounter many fights inconvenient incidents among neighbors hand another aspect considered calling strict laws total preventing sounds produced adjacent people could sounds unacceptable people still basic right arrange meetings parties homes others need listen music vital action soul wellbeing conclude order find balance advantages disadvantages governments might design flexible laws meet people needs example cities noise preventing valid specific periods day periods people supposed rest need silence
1,The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.,"The table chart gives information relative to a sample of 100 people in seven countries about the number of mobile phones and landlines. In general, there are more countries in which mobile phones are more used than landlines. Nonetheless, there are three countries in which the use of landlines is more spred.
In 5 countries out of 7 there is a high number of people who possess a mobile phone. In particular, in Italy 90 people out of 100 have a mobile phone. Sweden and UK immediately follow Italy with numbers that do not go under 80. The higher number of people with a mobile phone in Italy, UK and Sweden compensates the lower number of landlines, which does not exceed 70. Although, the number of people possessing a mobile phone is 70, even in Germany the use of mobile phone is preferred. Indeed, landlines are used by 60 people.
By contrast, there are three countries is which the number of people that use landlines is higher than the number of those who use mobile phones. The case of Canada is peculiar because it is the country with the lowest amount of people that use either mobile phones or landlines. Specifically, less than 30 Canadian have a mobile phone, whereas more than 60 use landlines. US's case is pretty similar to that of Canada. On the opposite side, Denmark is the country in which the number of people using landlines is the highest (almost 90 people) but there is no discrepancy with the number of people that use mobile phones (more that 80 people have a mobile phone).",,,,,,6.5,table chart gives information relative sample 100 people seven countries number mobile phones landlines general countries mobile phones used landlines nonetheless three countries use landlines spred 5 countries 7 high number people possess mobile phone particular italy 90 people 100 mobile phone sweden uk immediately follow italy numbers go higher number people mobile phone italy uk sweden compensates lower number landlines exceed although number people possessing mobile phone 70 even germany use mobile phone preferred indeed landlines used 60 people contrast three countries number people use landlines higher number use mobile phones case canada peculiar country lowest amount people use either mobile phones landlines specifically less 30 canadian mobile phone whereas 60 use landlines us case pretty similar canada opposite side denmark country number people using landlines highest almost 90 people discrepancy number people use mobile phones 80 people mobile phone
2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. Although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, I believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives.
The internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. To live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. They have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. This lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. A country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. Indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. By contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. Although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. The political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. For instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences.
Furthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. Indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. In the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. To go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. The ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in English, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. The companies will be able to expand their trade.

In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.
On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.
On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.

On the one hand, When every ethnic group reflects the society they belong to it. This will helps in creating postive representation of the society as they will learn about each others through several ways , like food, clothes and traditions. For example, a survey conducted by the minstry of tourism in Egypt showed around 90 percent of people agreed that this will helps to fill the gap of cultural differences, as it will facilitates communication across nations and enhance confidence and trust between both cultures.
On the other hand, tourism industry will benefit when the population is blended. This is because, alot of tourists will be attracted to that foreign destination. So, this will boost the economy of the nation as growing numbers of jobs will be available.As as result, unemployment rate will decrease.

In my opinion, people from different nationalities have their own points of view, therefore each of them provide different perspectives to make a country more developed.
People who lives in a country with one nationality generally do not want other people from different countries to migrate their countries. The reason for this kind of thought is about safety of their countries. Moreover, they do not want to employ people who migrated. Therefore, these countries become more and more isolated from other ones. In this globalization area, a country which has just a one way of thinking, do not have oppurtinity to develop and becoma a interest to different nationalities.
On the other hand countries with multinational populations have mixture of cultures. Each of the people provides a different tradition of their own nationality. These traditions may become a way of entertainment to attract tourists. Due to the tourism being a source of income, it is one of the development sources of a country.
In addition, nowadays, there are lots of countries who lets knowledagble employees from other nationalities to work in their countries. These high skilled workers can be positioned in the places in need. Their ideas can be valued. If a country support them, they can be the new face of the development.

In my opinion, I believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.
Mixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. For example, Jamaican has a superior body in running. They are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. Each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.
On the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. Such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. In addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. To exemplify, USA is one of the country that has multinational population. USA has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. USA is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.

Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.

In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.

To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.
However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.
If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.

If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.
However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.

The line graph demonstrates the number of yearly visits to Australia by overseas residents.
Overall, the total number of people who visited the six countries increased dramatically. The most visited country was Japan in both years (1975 and 2005) while the least visited country in those same years was China. Annual Overseas residents' visits in Australia grew significantly over the period of 30 years.
In regards to the table, 3.2 million people came to Japan during 1975. This number was 4 times more in 2005 as it reached 12 million. 500 thousand more people visited china in 2005 than in 1975 (800 thousand and 300 thousand, respectively). The total number of people who visited all six countries was 30.4 million in 2005, compared to 8.8 million in 1975.
In 1975, the number of visits by overseas residents was just below 10 million. The greatest growth happened to be between 1985 and 1995, where the number grew by around 9 million.

Some people believe that only those who are naturally gifted can perfrom greatly in fields such as art and sport while others do not. This essay will discuss both views and illustrate why anyone through constant practise and hardwork can have a bright future in both of these fields, whether it was sports or art.
Having natural talent in art or sports is surely an advantage that could lead to accomplishments in the future. It puts the person levels above those who are not as fortunate as him or her. For instance, Lionel Messi, arguably the best player to ever kick a ball, is considered by many football fans the most talented play in history. According to Messi's coach, he is not the most dedicated player out of his teammates since he does not put in the same amount of effort as many others, but he certaintly yields the best results. Personally, whenever I see him play, I feel that there is a unvisible force of attraction, similar to a magnet, between his foot and the ball. There are many examples where people invested many hours of their day into learning art, but could not produce something of high quality. My sister, who is 26 years old, is actually one of those examples. She spent 2 hours a day for four years practising art, but she could not draw better than my cousin, who is 12 years and rarely does any drawing.
On the other hand, if someone is willing to put in the work and ready to face whatever it takes to reach the top, he or she will definitely do so, even if no natural is found. After all, certain skills are needed in any field, including sport and art, and by frequent training, those skills could easily be aquirred. One of my close friends was overweight and could not score a single goal in a 90-minute handball match. However, after multiple hours put into improving his technique and abilities, he became the best player in school; he was chosen by the coach as a captain to lead our team in a tournament.
To conclude, although having talent eases the path to success, it is not a requirment for others to do the same thing, if they put in enough effort and have commitment.",,,,,,6.0,achieving success field requires dedication perservance people believe naturally gifted perfrom greatly fields art sport others essay discuss views illustrate anyone constant practise hardwork bright future fields whether sports art natural talent art sports surely advantage could lead accomplishments future puts person levels fortunate instance lionel messi arguably best player ever kick ball considered many football fans talented play history according messi coach dedicated player teammates since put amount effort many others certaintly yields best results personally whenever see play feel unvisible force attraction similar magnet foot ball many examples people invested many hours day learning art could produce something high quality sister 26 years old actually one examples spent 2 hours day four years practising art could draw better cousin 12 years rarely drawing hand someone willing put work ready face whatever takes reach top definitely even natural found certain skills needed field including sport art frequent training skills could easily aquirred one close friends overweight could score single goal handball match however multiple hours put improving technique abilities became best player school chosen coach captain lead team tournament conclude although talent eases path success requirment others thing put enough effort commitment

On the other hand, others believe we are the resposible for the distruction of certain natural environment. I believe the disadvantages could exceed the advantages.
Nowadays, thanks to the techonolical development, we have the great possibility to go anywhere and visit extraordinary places like the South Pole.

Although the workers of turistm sector claim to pay attention in preserving the natural status of places like the South Pole, it is impossibile to believe in them. Indeed, to welcome people and technological instruments is already a way in which a natural enviroment is stressed and ruined. In particular, techonological advices produce radiations, which toghether with chimical and electrical stimuli could afftect the ground of a place like the South Pole. For instance, radiations and electrical stimulations can make the temperature higher and this could be a cause of the environment's ruination. Furthermore, animals who live in the South Pole can be negatively influenced by the turists. Indeed, they are not social animals who have grown up together with human beings. They could get sick because of the noisy sounds produced by humans and by their techonolical advices.

Exploring is what scientists and tourists are always like and eager to do because, invariably, unknown keeps an attraction of mystery. However, there are pros and cons in travelling to remote natural environment.
As far as we know, the improvement in science and progress in technology always comes from exploring the unknown destinations. Travelling to a remote natural environment, take the South Pole for example, can conduct many research which cannot be done in common places. These kinds of research is helpful in Biology and in finding the origin of human being. The second biggest advantage is that it can improve the tourism in its local area, and tourism means a better condition for local people. In the past, in some remote places of China without torism, the native people there had a poor sanitory condition and after the arrivals of travellers, people there can earn a living and improve their living conditions.
However, everything in the world has its donwside. The activities in scientific research and commerce will cause contalmination to the environment in remote places. For instance, the constructions of the scientific stations have occupied the places where many wild animals there used to call home. There is no doubt that such activities will lead to a decrease in the number of these animals which will also influent the local ecosystem.

It' is often argued that there are some benefits and drawbacks of this type of journey. I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.
First of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.
On the other side, Web net based journey might be good alternative for those tourists who want to explore world but can't spend more money or resources on that journey. In this case remote journey is beneficial for both sides: for the natural environment which is staying safe from tourists' crowds interference, and for the tourists as well, as they shouldn't spend more resources on this kind of traveling. For instance, if person showing willingness to see the natural environment such as rainforest but can't travel, this type of the tourism might be the great chance. Though new technologies allow to see and even listen the natural environment voices whole, however real feelings and emotions of being for instance in the Southern Pole impossible to recieve when you are online.

This phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. This essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.
The dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. These drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. However, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. The other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. The improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. The most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.
To tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards.

In this essay, i am going to discuss the causes and some consequences of the widespread abuse of drugs by young adults, and give some recommendations that will help combat this trend.
To begin, it is a well known fact that the abuse of drugs can cause some devastating effects to the consumer. A lot of youths today, learnt this lifestyle from their parents, or thier immediate environment. For example, a teenager whose parents take cocaine, will inevitably take after the parents, afterall, an apple does not fall far away from its tree.
Also, a teenager that smokes illegal drugs like marijuana, might not even live to tell the rest of the stories. The chemical components of this drug are incredibly strong, that when abused, can lead to psychological symptoms, like, hallucinations, delusions, and even in worst cases death. A recent study, showed that 75% of young adults, who suffer from hallucinations and delusions, are as a result of intake of hard drugs.
In terms of recommendations, the governments should set up addiction clinic to help combat the ubiquitous trend among youths. This will go a long way in alleviating the addiction towards drugs. There should also be an awareness created to help instill fear into obstinate teenagers. Psychotherapy should also be recommended.

There are two main reasons why a young person decides to use drugs, namely, a dysfunctional family and depression. A dysfunctional family is known to be a family with a lack of communication, and this family isn’t worried about their son. For example, both parents are alcoholics, and they don’t care about their son. The child starts using drugs only because someone else does it. On the other hand, a young people suffering depression can easily become addicted. For example, a teenager is bullied at the school. He doesn’t want to go anymore and feels lonely. In order to change this situation, he finds a refuge in drugs because he feels confident and loved.
The effects of drug use by young people are multiples. Generally, they can’t be focused. They prefer to stay in an unreal world rather than the real world. For example, a student who dreams of become engineer will have issues to finish their studies.

In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.
This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.
The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.
There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.

Some people are concerned that their own local businesses will be taken by large companies. Although it is understandable to feel scared, and anxious, I disagree with this idea. People always need to adjust the issue flexibly. I would like to share examples and ideas in Japanese society.
To begin with, the majority of society is based on capitalist society. This means that people who run their own businesses are always competitive with competitors. This means that large companies are more beneficial to provide more convenient and high-quality services with affordable finance and ideas. For example, Japanese convenience stores are monopolized by three companies. These companies' stores are ubiquitous around Japan and they provide literary convenient services. Customers can buy magazines, underwear, and some special products, such as instant noodles which are featured by famous noodle restaurants. Customers can always buy the same products around Japan. Therefore, it must be difficult for local convenience stores to fight against large companies.
Secondly, this phenomenon is not necessarily cause a negative effect on local businesses and communities. As I mentioned above, it will cause more convenient to local people. Furthermore, the people who used to run the local convenience store will be able to run the large companies' convenience stores as franchised stores by taking advantage of their own experience. Furthermore, running some stores and companies, instead of running only one company is getting standard for entrepreneurs because they can prepare for the fast-paced society. The more they can constantly increase their profit , the more options have on whether they should compensate for a deficit sales figure in a store or company. Furthermore, they can just terminate the company and focus on the profitable company. By doing this process, they can survive in the competitive society.
In conclusion, it is unpredictable which industries and services suddenly emerge and take place of their own business. Therefore, people always need to keep up with this fast-paced society.",,,,,,6.0,recent years improvement immense expansion supermarkets including convenience stores often takes place local business people concerned local businesses taken large companies although understandable feel scared anxious disagree idea people always need adjust issue flexibly would like share examples ideas japanese society begin majority society based capitalist society means people run businesses always competitive competitors means large companies beneficial provide convenient services affordable finance ideas example japanese convenience stores monopolized three companies companies stores ubiquitous around japan provide literary convenient services customers buy magazines underwear special products instant noodles featured famous noodle restaurants customers always buy products around japan therefore must difficult local convenience stores fight large companies secondly phenomenon necessarily cause negative effect local businesses communities mentioned cause convenient local people furthermore people used run local convenience store able run large companies convenience stores franchised stores taking advantage experience furthermore running stores companies instead running one company getting standard entrepreneurs prepare society constantly increase profit options whether compensate deficit sales figure store company furthermore terminate company focus profitable company process survive competitive society conclusion unpredictable industries services suddenly emerge take place business therefore people always need keep society

On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.
Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications.

This phaenomenon have caused the development and expansion of supermaket but also the closure of local businesses. I agree with the part of people who think that local business play a vital role in the life of local commuities that will be almost death in the next few years.
In Italy 50 years ago to buy food people had to go to street market. They used to buy km 0 products respecting the season of production of fruit of vegetables. People have to talk to each other, people have to go shopping respecting the workhours of people who had to produce the products and then sold them. In the last year, supermaket have caught on. Their goal is to offer how many products possible, without taking care of the season in which a certain product should be found in the market. For instace, if you want to buy cherries in winter now you can to to the nearest supermarket and find them, even if is November. By contrast, before supermarket's developement people had to wait the productive season of cherries and waint until summer to eat them. This phaenomenon had take people to prefer supermarket because they can find more products. However the consequences of this choice are in my opinion dramatic.
First of all, the clousure of local business is causing a breakdown on the economical status of different countries. For instance, in Sicily there are still different people who work the ground and survive because they produce and sell their own products. It used to be their job. However, because of the supermakert their job is not apprecciated and they are losing money and the possibility to continue their job. This dramatic phaenomenon is surely causing the death of local communities because a vital part of the community itself is losing job. Another example coming from my personal experience might be the following. Nowadays you can buy a product to clean and polish your shoes in a supermaket. 50 years ago my grandfather used to go to the city center where a man used to clean and polish the shoes for him. It was his job. I had the extraordinary opportunity to meet this old man who clean and polish my shoes for little money. He was happy because, even if he is conscious that is almost impossibile, he hope to have the opportunity to do this job as long as possible. He told me that to clean shoes on the street for fifty years have given him the opportunity to meet people and to talk with them. After I have known him, I thought that because of globalisation we are losing our roots as well as the possibility of knowing our own place and people.

Many individuals believe that the shut down of local business could end the local communities. I fully consider that the generalisation of commercial market could destroy the spirit of localities because if owners closed their business, it would disappear local and familiar places for inhabitants and create a negative mental health.
Before having this modern invention, namely supermakets, local shops such as bakery or butcher have been there and where a place of regroupment and conviviality. However, due to the competitiveness of supemarket and the globalization of items, individuals may prefer to purchase in it rather than to go to each local business. This phenomenon decrease the visits of customers in small shops and would not help to boost their incomes. As a consequence, if local shops, which should be most of them in the city center due to old architecture such as in Europe, shut down, there will be no longer activities or inhabitants, and in the forthcoming decades, the city could be desertic.
Moreover, small businesses created employment, if they closed, people would make redundants. Indeed, in many research when people lose their jobs, it may create a negative mood and at worst sometimes a depression. This is to say that if everyone were discharged due to all those shut down, effects could be detrimental on local communities. For instance, in small cities, many events are organized such as parties or barbecues. However, if the population had a negative mood, anyone would join these activities which, normally, increase the dynamism of a city.

The production can be divided into three parts: working on the ground, work in the factory and selling. Just at the end of the second part coffee is reduced in the little particle we used to buy in supermarkets.
The first part can be divided into two parts. In both of them, the hand of the men is essential. The first step to start coffee production is to pick the coffee beans. The second part is to dry them. After this step, the second part of the production starts. This part is more mechanical rather than manual. Indeed, the coffee beans are roasted and then they start several types of processing ad grinding and mixing. At the end of these steps, coffee is made into a mixture ready to be frozen.
After becoming a mixture, coffee is almost ready to be sold. It acquires the texture of the coffee we buy in the grocery stores. The process, however, is not finished yet. There is a second type of grinding and after that coffee is dried again. This passage permits the water to evaporate. This is the last step that concern properly the production of coffee.

What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it.
To study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original.
By contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art.
In conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions.",,,,,,6.0,education children surely one hottest topic debated subjects skills children learn help grow better according one view art vital growht children therefore school subject hand people think art school waste time believe study art fundamental least two different factors teached schools surely dignity deserved study art different level education essential development certain skills first children play art develop ability measure structure picture well delineate border page earlier children educated drawing start recognising pictures distinguish colors possible mixtures second reason contrast linked psychological implications art involves art mean draw art help adults understand children needs children thanks drawing activity start expressing emotions desire using pictures colors start working imagination learn acquire writing reading skills two reasons lead people believe fundamental children art art subject considered useful mathematics english development creativity critical thinking art implies extraordinary useful indeed children led understand practically commit error drawing start think errors made possibility something new original contrast people dislike idea art compared subjects like math science believe art hobby something useful since notions child memorise test teacher prepare understand level children art considered subject therefore reasons teach schools however reasons presented want add art list school subjects misguided start idea learn means stay hours front book obsiusly true enough fundamental part learning advantaged practical activities like art conclusion believe art subject considered notions learnt drawing essential first basis grammar keeping necessary differences since children develop different skills art school subject supported help children develop least creativity critical reasoning well express emotions

Thirdly, after cooling beans, they have to be put in a machine in order to be grinded. The next phase leads to a mixture with hot water, followed by a straining and freezing one.
Furthermore, the resulting frozen liquid has to be grinded again.

In my opinion, since only art permits the develop of children's creativity, it has to be considered as important as the other school subjects such as science or history.
In 2018, it was conducted a research among 100 children in which only half of them were following art classes. The resulting outcome was mind-blowing: in fact, those which had the opportunity to learn more about art had develop their creative skills, while the others, athough some of them had a natural talent, had not made any improvement. Hence, the result has underlined the importance of this subject.
On the other hand, some people think that children use the hours of art in school only to have fun and play with colours. I believe that this is partly true; however, since children have the right to express theirselves, this time in which art is taught plays an important role in their education. For instance, many studies have underlined that children suffering from ADHD (a psychological issue that causes hyperactivity), since they are using their energies painting and creating sculptures, can be calmer thanks to art.

The diagram contains different graphs that each gives an idea of each step in order.
Overall, coffee processing takes eleven steps until it is readily available for us to consume.
First of all, farmers pick the beans off the trees as they ripen and then expose them to the sun in the open air to dry. Afterwards, the dried beans are put in a big closed pot in which the beans are roasted by heat.
Then, and rapidly, the heated beans are cooled off. In the fifth step, the beans are put in a grinder where they are crushed into tiny pieces. The crushed beans then are mixed with hot water and the mixture is strained.
Additionally, the mixture is then cooled till they are frozen. In this step the product is just a frozen liquid that is grinded again.

Whether someone sees its value or not, art will one way or another find its way in our children's lives and have an influence. I strongly believe that art is crucial for our children to have as a subject at school and in this article I will try to explain why I believe so and give examples.
One of the major reasons why art is so essential is the diversity of the genres of art. Art could be in the form of playing music instruments, drawing, acting or even doing martial arts.
This diversity gives children the ability to choose what suits them best and focus on getting better at them. Not only that,but this also forms a big part of their personality. It is scientifically proven that this increases the average IQ of a child and it protects from depression later in the children's lives.
On the other hand, some parents have a different point of view, they see art as a distraction, believing that only merely scientific subjects are the real deal. However, their view may seem to look logical, as their wish is that their children would grow up to be doctors, scientists or something similar. I believe this is a noble goal but why not a doctor who can play a guitar? Or a scientist who is also a good actor ? Would not that be a great hobby to have in their free time?
An example that I encountered was when I started to learn martial arts and played the guitar and how this greatly helped me overcome a really tough time in my life and fight off depression.

In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.
Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.
However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.
Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.

The following essay will illuminate the problems of people relying on private cars and possible solutios to deal with that .
Nowadays , people have to drive hours to arrive their works , schools and shops they determined . However , in order to arrive quickly and comfortably ,people tend to drive their own cars ,even though if they have to drive long distances . As a result of that , many issues are considered like, traffic congestion and pollution of environment. Furhtermore, buying cars are expensive and cost alot of saving money ,which can add more financial burden over mid class families. Moreover , having more cars on the road ,increase the risk for accidents which could be fatal in many conditions.
However , having such problems had pushed governments to put plans to resolve them .For instance ,in some countires in Europe ,alot of money spent by governments to improve public tranport , also these countries encourage their people to use public transport by having low price tickets .In fact , today many people in France and Spain have decided to use subways , trains and buses as ulternative way to tranport . Likewise , in Canada , USA and Australia , as a result of having big lands ,big hospitals have offered to transfer some patients with critical medical conditions by heliocopters .

The use of the car as the main means of travel leads, first of all, to an increase in the number of cars and thus to traffic disruption. This disruption exacerbates drivers stress and increases the number of accidents.
The other disadvantage of permanent car use is pollution. More cars means more gases escaping and therefore a danger for our planet in a short time.
Many solutions exist to deal with this situation. First of all, I think of free public transport. As gasoline becomes more and more expensive, people might consider using public transportation more often. Since a bus can carry so many people, this solution will reduce the number of cars on the streets and solve the problems on the previous paragraph.
Another solution might be to create public transport that is totally green, in other words without greenhouse gas emissions. Sometimes people think that large-scale transport causes a lot of pollution. Solving this problem could change their minds and, of course, help our planet.
In conclusion, people think that using only private cars is easier and more appropriate, but they do not realize that this behavior leads to environmental and health problems.

But, overusage of car from people can lead to air pollution and destruction to the environment as greenhouse gases are produced, which are harmful to our body. To solve this problem, many countries are encouraging people to use electronic car or campaigning to use bus or train when they commute.
2 weeks ago, I saw an environmental documentary from the television and I heard the cause of air pollution. There were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. When we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. If we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. Therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.
To prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. This will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.
In conclusion, many people prefer to ride the private car as it is more comfortable, however, the consequences of usage of car are harmful to the environment and people's health, therefore government should educate or persuade people to use public transports instead of riding a car.",,,,,,6.5,nowadays people using private car major means transportation overusage car people lead air pollution destruction environment greenhouse gases produced harmful body solve problem many countries encouraging people use electronic car campaigning use bus train commute 2 weeks ago saw environmental documentary television heard cause air pollution many factors could effect air pollution one factors usage car ride car car produces harmful chemical gases carbon dioxide lead foggy weather inhale gases often lungs become unhealthy worst case lead death therefore cars increase number people lung disease produce bad chemicals prevent production harmful chemicals car many people use bus train transportation rather private car government campaign use make festival persuade people use public transport help environment reduce greenhouse gases people inhale fresh air conclusion many people prefer ride private car comfortable however consequences usage car harmful environment people health therefore government educate persuade people use public transports instead riding car

This in turn has entailed various repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to address a few pitfalls that might be resulted from the rising dependence on cars, and then I will try to consolidate some available solutions.
With the recent development in the car industry, private cars have been quite affordable products for a large portion of the society. Therefore, most of the people have started to travel by their own cars toward their destinations. This increase in vehicles traveling in the streets has alarmingly caused many traffic jams, and these in turn have costed the national economics enormous lost work hours. Moreover, the extent of the air pollution has been widened as a result of the increasing toxic materials emitted into the air. In addition, number of traffic accidents apparently has seen an expected surge, since it has a proportional relation to cars quantities travelling within the cities.
In order to minimize the problems mentioned above, a few solutions can be offered. First, governments should pour more money into developing the public transportation infrastructures, which might encourage employees to forgo their private cars and alternatively take the bus or train. Other notion which merits consideration, employers should intervene and organize group transits for transferring workers from and to their homes. In tourism circles, if there had been more focus on group packages, many tourists would have preferred to leave their cars at home.

2,Write about the following topic.Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As we all know, recruitment is a continuous process that has been evolving over the past years. Nowadays, selection of qualified applicants is a tedious job which involves a considerable amount of time and effort. It has been stated that wealthy countries must allow experienced and intelligent employees from impoverished countries to secure a job in an affluent nation. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, reasons and examples will be discussed further.
Recruitment mainly involves identification of potential applicants, screening, interviewing and hiring candidates for a particular organization. It may seem a daunting task for those working in human resources. With the advent of technology, the process is simplified, faster and more convenient. Mostly, email is used for applying and sending the credentials abroad, chances of getting hired is often possible. For instance, many immigrants from Asia, which belongs to developing countries are able to successfully obtain an employment in North America with the help of social media platforms. Also, with their valuable experience and rewarding career in the past, they were able to practice their profession in newly industralized countries.
It is beneficial for them to accept skilled workers from economically poor countries to fill in the vacancies in labor market. For instance, a highly respected nurse who earned her bachelor's degree back home decided to work overseas as a healthcare aide eventhough she's overqualified for the position while waiting for her credential evaluation and license. This scenario depicts that rich countries benefit and utilize this person's ability to contribute significantly in the economy.
In addition, job recruitment is advantageous for the country since talents and skills of the people from developing countries has been internationally recognized, thereby giving a sense of pride and honor. Moreover, hiring of people overseas should be a fair procedure that takes into consideration the most indispensable requirement which is skills and knowledge, not merely based on the worker's country of origin. However, there are also drawbacks associated from recruitment of foreign workers which include increasing costs, loss of cultural ties and conflict of interest.
From my perspective, I am in favor of hiring people from third world countries since majority of these people has the expertise, achievements and excellent communication skills which are desirable attributes of an employee. With enough manpower, it will address the staffing crisis and labor shortage in rich countries.",,,,,,7.5,know recruitment continuous process evolving past years nowadays selection qualified applicants tedious job involves considerable amount time effort stated wealthy countries must allow experienced intelligent employees impoverished countries secure job affluent nation completely agree statement essay reasons examples discussed recruitment mainly involves identification potential applicants screening interviewing hiring candidates particular organization may seem daunting task working human resources advent technology process simplified faster convenient mostly email used applying sending credentials abroad chances getting hired often possible instance many immigrants asia belongs developing countries able successfully obtain employment north america help social media platforms also valuable experience rewarding career past able practice profession newly industralized countries beneficial accept skilled workers economically poor countries fill vacancies labor market instance highly respected nurse earned bachelor degree back home decided work overseas healthcare aide eventhough overqualified position waiting credential evaluation license scenario depicts rich countries benefit utilize person ability contribute significantly economy addition job recruitment advantageous country since talents skills people developing countries internationally recognized thereby giving sense pride honor moreover hiring people overseas fair procedure takes consideration indispensable requirement skills knowledge merely based worker country origin however also drawbacks associated recruitment foreign workers include increasing costs loss cultural ties conflict interest perspective favor hiring people third world countries since majority people expertise achievements excellent communication skills desirable attributes employee enough manpower address staffing crisis labor shortage rich countries

I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.
The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.
The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africa
and citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".

There are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries.

2,"Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",,,,,,6.5,huge discrepancy rich countries poor ones constant society years although rich countries give financial supports poorer seems problem poverty far find solution people suggest opt kinds help partly agree argue financial skills intellectual support integrated economical help countries sent third world financial support surely essential order help poorer country sane situations however money without managment abilities useful enough indeed governement called thrid world since possess managerial investment skills chance make productive money used receive spend money solve immediate issues deal without caring future perspective instance nowadays countries used send economical help african countries poorer spend money receive built hospitals schools buy medicines primary necessity products need involve soon money resources bought finished even mantain open hospitals schools poverty poorer country need economical support enough need also professional people teach managerial skill need development countries essential understand invest money make money starting support poorer used receive rather need guided contemporary economical attituted richer countries developing years idea presented confirmed fact countries third world used defined richer least natural resources nonetheless able exploit natural capital posses lack skills tanzania instance place full interesting products however specialised people able interact richer country order start business send money without teaching use give child bycicle without teaching riding child learned technique behind riding never worth knowing conclusion believe countries integrate words althought money essential help order permit survival people poorer countries important countries improve managerial skills go poverty

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Yes, I agree that rich countries should also give other types of help rather than finantial aid.
Some poor countries needs various types of help in order to develop themselfs. Educational help would have a major impact when associated with finantial help.
We can not interrupt the finantial help only by itself but we can ask for some accomplishments by the country which is receiving finantial help.
For example, a country would only receive next year finantial help if some rules or goals were accomplished by their government.
Educational infrastructres, help for children in school like aquiring IT equipment and the development of internet conection which in some countries there isn´t.
Books for children, meals during the school time would be very important, because it is trough education from very early that a country can develop itself.
Another example is in Agriculture field and environment. Frequently these countries have rudimentary forms of agricultre which demands old habits and dificult conditions for the farmers. A developed country when helping these countries, can also help with knowledgment, laws and protocols of agriculture. Today Agriculture has lots of technology helping farmers, businessmen and anyone linking with this area. Transmitting to these countries the tools and knowledge can also improve these countries to be more independent when we talk about agriculture. An organized agriculture department would mean less dependency of other coutries.
The environment is also a subject very important when talking about help to poor countries. It is a global issue, and these countries very often produce polluents. Transmiting them the importance in saving our planet it is a major goal. Again, knowledge, tools, forms of producing, technology can help not only the eficiency in the economy but also the environment. Transmitting the future generation the problems of our planet, the risks of global warming it is also a way to help.
Basically the help has to be individual, because the poor countries have their own singular problems, and so, we have to check individually those countries in order to help eficiently. Some countries have wars, other ones don´t even have organized governments. Other ones have organized governments and no wars but lack of basic needs such food, health and education. So it is important to not only help finantially but also dive in those countries individually on order to help efficiently.",,,,,,6.5,yes agree rich countries also give types help rather finantial aid poor countries needs various types help order develop themselfs educational help would major impact associated finantial help interrupt finantial help ask accomplishments country receiving finantial help example country would receive next year finantial help rules goals accomplished government educational infrastructres help children school like aquiring equipment development internet conection countries books children meals school time would important trough education early country develop another example agriculture field environment frequently countries rudimentary forms agricultre demands old habits dificult conditions farmers developed country helping countries also help knowledgment laws protocols agriculture today agriculture lots technology helping farmers businessmen anyone linking area transmitting countries tools knowledge also improve countries independent talk agriculture organized agriculture department would mean less dependency coutries environment also subject important talking help poor countries global issue countries often produce polluents transmiting importance saving planet major goal knowledge tools forms producing technology help eficiency economy also environment transmitting future generation problems planet risks global warming also way help basically help individual poor countries singular problems check individually countries order help eficiently countries wars ones even organized governments ones organized governments wars lack basic needs food health education important help finantially also dive countries individually order help efficiently

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.
I agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.
On the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to. Food and clothes help as well, many civilians don't have the privilege to warm themselves up, or get full. This will help with their quality of life.",,,,,,6.5,rich countries often give money poorer countries solve poverty therefore developed countries give types help unprivileged countries rather financial aid agree part seen history sadly leaders countries always thinking helping citizens money got gifted world leaders could think first satisfy anything else sometimes world leaders help helping build armies buy weapons destruction countries decide help countries financial aid analyze world leader see type world leader could world leader shows signs selfishness money wo help citizens help situation citizens find world leader helping financial aid could go violent cause riots revolutions huge decrease currency strength increase poverty homelessness famine hand sending resources beverages clothes books help increase number educated people country would far useful unfortunately types countries problem education among citizens many citizens want educate able food clothes help well many civilians privilege warm get full help quality life

For this reason, some people state that people, including students need to learn cutting-edge technology, such as IT program outweigh the importance of learning history. Furthermore, they often state there is no value of learning history. Although some people's opinions are understandable to some extent, I strongly believe people continuously need to learn history to recognize modern social issues. I would like to state some reasons and examples to support my opinion.
Initially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. People kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. In addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. As a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as America for the workforce and looked down on slaves. If people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. Therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.
Secondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. Some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. After the Industrial Revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.
In addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. Unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.
Finally, the causes of our modern society's problems as I mentioned above can be recognized by studying history.

So looking behind us will not bring alot of benefits that can influence our life in a positive way , those people who believe in this rely on the facts that past will never repeat himself .Likewise , living in present and trying to learn from old stories has little values in a matter how to change the future .
However , personally i absolute disagree with this notion , and think that past can teach us many valuable lessons which can pave our future in way that we prohibit ourself to make same mistakes that our ancestors have done in past . For instance , by looking at the history of people in Europe ,we can see that during the earliest of twentieth century , people there went through a hostile conflict and as a result of that ,millions of lives have been lost as a price of anger and avarice . Afterwards , 100 years passed and nowadays people in Europe are taught to solve their problems away from violence and have a better understanding for their future .

From my perspective, it is not true. I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.
At first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.
Besides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.

2,Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people claim that nothing about the past is valuable for life in the present day. From my perspective, it is not true. I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.
At first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.
Besides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.
In conclusion, individuals should, indeed, learn from the past.

Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.
For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.
Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.
The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.

Two big differences between the metro in the different cities concern the length of the route and the yearly number of passengers. Although there are some underground railway systems that have been opened more recently, the oldest ones (London, Paris and Tokyo) are the most frequented and long.
There is a big difference concerning the length of km of underground railways systems. In London, that is the oldest metro system built in 1863, thereis the longest system, almost 400 km. Instead, Kyoto has the shortest metro system with just 11km of route. There is a huge discrepancy between the metro systems that have been built in Kyoto and Los Angeles. Although in these two cities the underground systems were built more recently, respectively in 1981 and 2001, they have the shortest systems. For instance in L.A. the route does not exceed 30km). There is at least a discrepancy of more than 100 km between the younger subways (Kyoto and Los Angeles) and the older ones. Indeed, Washington DC, that was built in 1927, is 126 km long.
The number of passenger per year is almost directly proportionate to the lenght of route. However there are some differences to be noted.

Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.
On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.
There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.
In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.",,,,,,6.5,competition instructive toxic children debate around topic believe sense competition supported standpoint believe rather compete children learn believe supporters competicions partly right also children essential two strategy taken together give childrens tools need became useful adults one hand people believe compete essential growth children believe competitions rise ambitions children develop certain attitudes thanks always bigger dreams desire idea therefore children grown making competiions became important managers instinctive desire winners successful persons true competitions permit childrens develop ambitions best order win however strongly believe good understanding aim competitions taught start compete indeed children understand instructive role competition manage possible distructive consequences could derive child ready lose children start competition aware possibility lose possibility win believe important stimulate children competitions teaching important role defeats role coperation lead analyse second standpoint indeed people dislike competitions believe toxic growth children according negative teach children rather children learn work together surely vital skill workplaces ability work team one searched different businesses learn work together means children understand role group also think ideas support team permits children develop fundamental social skills however alone enough children instruction believe possible child also learning work produce something alone children order advances ideas give good support team learn ambitious possible thanks competitions conclusion believe instruction single competitions well encouraged useful productive order grow efficient adults

But, others think youngsters who were taught to share and be corporative will turn into helpful adults.
The sense of competition indeed can generate excitement and can push youngsters to give their best. On the other hand, the competitive feeling can cause hatred among children, especially if the parents were pressuring their child to always take the lead. For example, when I was nine years old I used to have a friend in my class that had a great sense of competition. She often caused problems when she lose or answered wrong. Unfortunately, the teacher got to know with the encouragement of her parents the girl felt pressured and the fear of disappointing them. In addition, parents can teach their children to co-operate and to engage with other youngster, to motivate them and to help them learn how to share, which can become a great experience when they get older and be more understanding and considerate.
However, a sense of competition is not always frustrating it can encourage a youngster to develop new behavior that can help them to discover adventurous journeys. Furthermore, being competitive among children might attract shy children to engage more and break the wall of fear.
In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is far better than being competitive. It can improve children behaviour in positive way.

Some people hold that adolescents should be encouraged to compete, while others disagree and argue that teaching children to work together is more important. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those highlighting the importance of competition, these people may have their position grounded upon the fact that children can learn a lot by competing against each other, especially when they encounter numerous obstacles brought by their strong opponents and suffer failures. Only under such adverse conditions can children understand their drawbacks and the ways of improvement. Apart from that, if children have hard-earned victories over competent rivals, they are likely to gain tremendous pleasure of success as well as huge confidence that motivates them to keep working diligently and achieve more success.
On the contrary, in terms of those attaching greater importance to cooperation than to competition, these people may justify their position by citing a large number of examples elucidating the role of collaboration in various tasks, such as the production of a high-tech gadget of which the parts are manufactured by different countries, and a formal meeting where people present their respective views on a given issue in order to comprehenively understand the situation. Admittedly, these examples sufficiently explain the importance of cooperation. However, this does not mean that cooperation must outweigh competition since the two ways of interaction influence us differently and it is rather impractical to identify which one is more influential to us.
To sum up, competition and cooperation benefit us in different ways.

There is a debate conserning the activities that should be porsued during the free time. There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution.
It is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time.
On the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind.

Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.
Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.
There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music.

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.
The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.
Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.
In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others.

Overall, male buyers outnumbered female counterparts in all three types. At the same time, the distribution of people favouring pop music was almost identical to those buying rock music albums. However, the percentages for people of different ages fond of classical music showed a huge disparity from the other two types.
In detail, nearly 30% of males purchased pop or rock music albums, compared to approximately 19% of female counterparts. Among the four age groups, teenagers (16-24) and young people (25-35) were main pop and rock music supporters, with each group contributing roughly 30%. Around one quarter of people in their middle age (35-45) bought pop or rock music, whereas only one in ten people older than 45 favoured these two types of music.
On the other hand, regardless of their gender, classical music lovers only made half proportion as much as those who love pop and rock music. Interestingly, slightly over 20% of people older than 45 paid for classical music albums, while teenagers (16-24) and middle-aged people (25-35) accounted for no more than 3% combined in this category.

2,There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Two centuries ago, when people celebrated the evolutionary development brought by industrialization, no one would ever anticipate that a profound change of global climate would be caused by the “machines” humans had made. However, many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem, which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures. This essay will explain the major causes of global climate change, followed by several plausible solutions.
It has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change, and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. First, our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity, acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal. A colossal amount of smoke, predominantly carbon dioxide, is released during this process. As a result, the smoke captures excessive heat on the Earth, resulting in an increase in global temperatures. Second, consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way. As the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs, more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum. The process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Thus, burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change.
However, although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, several actions could decelerate the effect. One major step is to urge the energy-dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries. Like large cloth manufacturers, giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day. By reducing productivity, the amount of energy they need can drop. At the same time, the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate. On the other hand, individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints. Every small step, such as turning off the lights when leaving home, taking public transportations instead of driving cars, or simply eating less meat, can make big changes.
In conclusion, the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures. Nevertheless, this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals.",,,,,,8.0,two centuries ago people celebrated evolutionary development brought industrialization one would ever anticipate profound change global climate would caused machines humans made however many ecologists point human activities put massive burden ecosystem leads increasingly higher global temperatures essay explain major causes global climate change followed several plausible solutions widely recognized excessive greenhouse gas emissions culprit global climate change burning fossil fuels consuming oil leading causes greenhouse gas emissions first daily life modern society heavily relies electricity acquired mainly burning fossil fuels like coal colossal amount smoke predominantly carbon dioxide released process result smoke captures excessive heat earth resulting increase global temperatures second consuming oil impacts global temperatures way energy burning fossil fuels meet rapidly growing needs oil extraction programs set acquire petroleum process drilling oil consuming creates significant amount greenhouse gases thus burning fossil fuels consuming oil significant causes climate change however although lowering greenhouse gas emissions challenging several actions could decelerate effect one major step urge companies reduce productivity create jobs green industries like large cloth manufacturers giant companies need significant portion energy keep machines running every day reducing productivity amount energy need drop time government increase investment green industries maintain healthy employment rate hand individuals make contribution reducing personal carbon footprints every small step turning lights leaving home taking public transportations instead driving cars simply eating less meat make big changes conclusion excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly burning fossil fuels consuming oil caused alarming increase global temperatures nevertheless problem could alleviated collective effort giant companies individuals

Pop Music is a genre that most people age 16-24 enjoy. Therefore, just above 30% of purchases are made by them. Following them are adults from 25 to 34 years old, who has 30% of purchases. Generally, males are more interested in this type of music, thats why around 28% of males buys it and nearly 18% of females has interest to purchase it. Forty-five years old and older are the least fascinated age to this type of music. Lastly, Adults between 34-44 do have interest to this type of genre, so it is the third highest age group with 25% of buying it.
In conclusion, Pop Music is clearly more famous to younger adults. As shown in the bar graph, the older you are, the less interest you have to this kind of music.

2,There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Global warming is a serious global threat that no one can deny. The causes of making temperatures higher can be for various reason, but rencently there is a growing evidence that man-made activties are causing it. Man-made activites such as pollution can be one of the causes. Nowadays, we must focus on how we can deal with them and solbe the problem. This essay will include the causes and the solution on why our earth temperature is increasing.
At first, we are polluting the earth without realizing the threats or problems that this can cause in the future, that is because of the unawarness of our society. One of the main causes of the rising temperatures is factories. Factories production can cause severe air pollution, because of the burning waste or by blowing air that include chemicals out to the fresh air. The current rise of temperature is alarming. Deforestation is another reasons to this problem. Deforestation is caused by humans to sell it or use for our own benefit, but in reality we are killing planet earth.
To every problem there are solution. Since we are already in this problem; we better find a solution before it is too late. Even though there are man-made activites that are causing the problem, but there are some that can solve it. The introduction of electronic car is the beginning of the solution, where the use of diesel are decreased to make our vehicles more eco-friendly. As we can see today, restaurants and cafes are serving plastic straws; even though, this will not solve the problem immediately, but it is a good start to make our life more friendly to our environment.
In conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that must not be avoided. Although, we did put ourselves in this position, but we will also be able to fix it. The causes that drove us to this problem are used for a long time. However, reducing the amount of factory production or introducing eco-friendly machinery can be our way out.",,,,,,6.0,global warming serious global threat one deny causes making temperatures higher various reason rencently growing evidence activties causing activites pollution one causes nowadays must focus deal solbe problem essay include causes solution earth temperature increasing first polluting earth without realizing threats problems cause future unawarness society one main causes rising temperatures factories factories production cause severe air pollution burning waste blowing air include chemicals fresh air current rise temperature alarming deforestation another reasons problem deforestation caused humans sell use benefit reality killing planet earth every problem solution since already problem better find solution late even though activites causing problem solve introduction electronic car beginning solution use diesel decreased make vehicles see today restaurants cafes serving plastic straws even though solve problem immediately good start make life friendly environment conclusion global warming serious issue must avoided although put position also able fix causes drove us problem used long time however reducing amount factory production introducing machinery way
1,The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.,"The bar charts enumerate the percentage of British people buying three different genres of music albums.
In general, the figures of Pop Music are analogous to those of Rock Music with both having the greatest purchase from young adults. Classical Music albums are mostly bought by middle-aged people. However, all three genres have more purchase from the male population.
Looking first of all at Pop and Rock Music albums, nearly 30% men bought them while slightly less than 20% women purchased them. Comparing the age demographics, 25-34 group(more than 30%) contributed to most purchases, followed by approximately 30% of 16-24 and about 25% of 35-44 paid for Pop and Rock albums. Only around 10% of 45+ purchased these two albums.
On the contrary, Classical Music is more popular among 45+ with about 20% of them purchasing the albums. Approximately 15% of 25-34 acquired classical music albums. And this genre was least purchased by 16-24 and 35-44 groups with values of about 1% and 3% respectively.

2,There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Despite knowing about the adverse effects of climate change, human activities have been highly responsible for global warming for decades. This essay will discuss the main causes of temperature rising including the excessive use of fossil fuels and plastic pollution. This essay will further suggest solutions to these problems including decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the dumping of waste in the sea.
Most people are guzzling fossil fuels, churning out greenhouse gases and messing with our planet's climate like there's no tomorrow. For instance, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, resulting in an increase in carbon footprint. The combustion of fossil fuels emits CO2, which in turn traps heat in the atmosphere, hence making it the primary contributor to global warming. Moreover, dumping plastic in oceans deprive phytoplanktons of sunlight. As a result, the planktons are not able to carry out photosynthesis, a process that removes CO2 and releases oxygen, which leads to disruption of the world's carbon cycle and ultimately makes the planet warmer. Thus human activities that contribute to an escalation in CO2 emissions are the prime causes of a rise in global temperature.
Substituting fossil fuels with other renewable energy sources and reducing plastic usage are both critical to mitigating this phenomenon. For example, people should install solar lights in their homes instead of Led bulbs. We should also curb the buying of processed or canned foods and should always take our own paper bags while going  grocery shopping to prevent the use of plastic bags. Furthermore, using public transportations rather than private vehicles for commuting would significantly alleviate our carbon footprint. Therefore, if humans shift to renewable and recyclable materials then it would drastically minimise the temperature rising issues.
To conclude, people's actions that change the environment have a negative impact on the global climate. However, we can substantially lessen it by curbing fossil fuels and plastic usage.",,,,,,8.0,despite knowing adverse effects climate change human activities highly responsible global warming decades essay discuss main causes temperature rising including excessive use fossil fuels plastic pollution essay suggest solutions problems including decreasing consumption fossil fuels reducing dumping waste sea people guzzling fossil fuels churning greenhouse gases messing planet climate like tomorrow instance driving grocery store burns certain amount fuel resulting increase carbon footprint combustion fossil fuels emits co2 turn traps heat atmosphere hence making primary contributor global warming moreover dumping plastic oceans deprive phytoplanktons sunlight result planktons able carry photosynthesis process removes co2 releases oxygen leads disruption world carbon cycle ultimately makes planet warmer thus human activities contribute escalation co2 emissions prime causes rise global temperature substituting fossil fuels renewable energy sources reducing plastic usage critical mitigating phenomenon example people install solar lights homes instead led bulbs also curb buying processed canned foods always take paper bags going grocery shopping prevent use plastic bags furthermore using public transportations rather private vehicles commuting would significantly alleviate carbon footprint therefore humans shift renewable recyclable materials would drastically minimise temperature rising issues conclude people actions change environment negative impact global climate however substantially lessen curbing fossil fuels plastic usage

2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.
There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.
In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.
To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.",,,,,,7.0,people argue equal numbers male female students accepted every major personally disagree statement number arguments support stance begin impossible enroll equal genders students every subject true faculties underrepresented particular gender example stem subjects usually male students females opposite true subjects phenomenon seems violate principle fight endeavor today gender equality therefore people want accept equal numbers students achieve gender balance every subject however reality different genders prefer study different subjects unequal opportunity according one research women show higher interest subjects like education psychology arts rather subjects result apparent admitting equivalent proportions male female students hardly achieved addition deprive students chances make choices universities enroll genders equally every subject mandatorily noted students right select subjects freely college students register subjects want study enough quotas left particular gender students forced study subjects interested need fulfill gender requirement class hinder students learning conclude universities enroll equal gender students every subject impossible achieve may deprive students freedom choose major want study

What implications do the indicators have for the countries?","The table illustrates social and economic measures for Canada, Japan, Peru, and Zaire during 1994.
It can be clearly seen that Zaire's points were the lowest in all indicators.
According to the data, Canada's annual earnings per person was 11,100 $ in 1994. However, the peak of this characteristic was in Japan at approximately 16,000. Alternatively, people from Peru and Zaire had the lowest income this year, 160$ and 130$ per person. Another economic measure was life expectancy at birth. The statistic shows the overall expected lifespan in Canada was 76 in 1994, while in Japan, the number was 78. Comparing the average limits of life expectancy at birth in Peru and Zaire were 51 and 41, respectively.
The first social indicator compares the daily calorie supply per person. It can be seen that on average a person from Canada had more than 3000 calories per day in 1994, while in Japan this factor amounted to 2864. Peru and Zaire had the lowest points in this category. Their percentages were also the lowest in the category of adults who were able to read and write, compared to Canada and Japan, which points were identical (99 and 99).",,,,,,5.0,table illustrates social economic measures canada japan peru zaire clearly seen zaire points lowest indicators according data canada annual earnings per person however peak characteristic japan approximately alternatively people peru zaire lowest income year 160 130 per person another economic measure life expectancy birth statistic shows overall expected lifespan canada 76 1994 japan number comparing average limits life expectancy birth peru zaire 51 41 respectively first social indicator compares daily calorie supply per person seen average person canada 3000 calories per day 1994 japan factor amounted peru zaire lowest points category percentages also lowest category adults able read write compared canada japan points identical 99 99
2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.
On the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.
In conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality.",,,,,,7.0,people believe educational facilities must accept numbers men women every subject pros cons argument discussed essay tremendous number people think equality crucial education nowadays activists fight women rights want every female study everything prefers notwithstanding socially acceptable moreover many feminists suggest patriarchal societies allow women study equality men example little boy says younger sister intelligent enough men play little girl grows thinks study men subjects work men jobs therefore main reason accept equal numbers sexes crush many stereotypes women intellectual abilities allow choose subject really want study hand people complain discrimination men instance every university accept 50 men highest grades every subject men average grades higher women accepted furthermore idea guarantee wise women study universities females also want learn every existing subject conclusion main point equality education choice coercion point view would great male female students could study subjects boys prefer teachers girls like scientists however impossible lot stereotypes exist coercion universities accept balanced numbers students based genders help solve global issue equality

2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Regarding education, gender equity is crucial. Some people argue that universities should enrol an equal number of men and women in every field. Personally, I totally agree with that statement because I believe it is fairer and it is better for the society.
The main reason male and female students should be equal in number is that it would be more equitable. In fact, numerous studies have stated that their brains are not working the same way. In other words, their cognitive capacities are different, so they should not compete with each other for university admissions. It does not mean that a gender is more intelligent than the other. For example, men are generally known to have a better spacial orientation, while women's ability to memorize is superior. Similarly, their physical capacities are not the same either, and that is why men and women do not compete against each other in sports competitions.
Another reason to separate sexes regarding university admissions is because it ensure a better distribution of gender among the labor market. Broadly speaking, it is well known that males work, in their life, more hours that females. This is principally due to the fact that women take more maternity leave than men. Unfortunately, it can consequently create a problem in the society.For example, nowadays, women represent the majority of students in medicine as they have better grades in high school. As a result, there is not enough working staff in hospitals when they quit to take care of their families. The same situation applies to every field with a majority of women such as jobs in health services.
In conclusion, I reiterate that there should be an equal number of male and female students enrolled in universities because it would be more equitable and ensure a better repartition of genders among different fields of employment.",,,,,,7.0,regarding education gender equity crucial people argue universities enrol equal number men women every field personally totally agree statement believe fairer better society main reason male female students equal number would equitable fact numerous studies stated brains working way words cognitive capacities different compete university admissions mean gender intelligent example men generally known better spacial orientation women ability memorize superior similarly physical capacities either men women compete sports competitions another reason separate sexes regarding university admissions ensure better distribution gender among labor market broadly speaking well known males work life hours females principally due fact women take maternity leave men unfortunately consequently create problem example nowadays women represent majority students medicine better grades high school result enough working staff hospitals quit take care families situation applies every field majority women jobs health services conclusion reiterate equal number male female students enrolled universities would equitable ensure better repartition genders among different fields employment

Overall, the indicator includes four aspects, annual income, life expectancy at birth, daily calories supply per person, and the adult literacy rate expresses in %.

The highest annual income per person was verified in Japan with 15,760$ whereas, Canada obtained 15,760$. However, it is notably the marked difference in this index compared to Peru and Zaire,160$,130£, respectively.

2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, universities are accepting all the students, as many men as women in every subject matter. I believe that being open to all students is fair. The university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual, regardless of gender.
However, I think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic. Even though, in general, I completely agree that there must be equality and human rights.
Nowadays, many are the organizations created, to support equality, sex discrimination, with the aim of helping people to get their rights. However, despite enormous positive changes compared to the past, still, some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men. What does it even mean? Should a woman only do house chores and raise kids? As can be seen, based on women's experience, a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time. There is an old saying, 'Give me an educated mother and I will give you an educated nation'. Therefore, I disagree with some people's beliefs. Men and women can be great in different jobs and positions.
However, having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities. Realistically speaking, there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other. In terms of numbers, if we think that, for instance, in the nursery degree there is 50 % of females and, then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males, it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students.
In a nutshell, universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number. As the applications arrive at the university, they should select people based on their skills, knowledge, and merits. No matter if the course will be 80% females and 20% male or vice versa.",,,,,,6.0,nowadays universities accepting students many men women every subject matter believe open students fair university must allow everyone study interesting individual regardless gender however think numbers equality course statistically speaking unrealistic even though general completely agree must equality human rights nowadays many organizations created support equality sex discrimination aim helping people get rights however despite enormous positive changes compared past still people reckon jobs women others men even mean woman house chores raise kids seen based women experience woman businesswoman great mother time old saying educated mother give educated nation therefore disagree people beliefs men women great different jobs positions however number students course impractical universities realistically speaking courses attract one gender terms numbers think instance nursery degree 50 females half waiting filled form males would harsh university close course parity future students nutshell universities accept one gender particular course gender fixed number applications arrive university select people based skills knowledge merits matter course 80 females 20 male vice versa

Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.
Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.
Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.
While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.
To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies.

Imperoving the environment is the duty of each and every living being living in the society, only governments and large companies together cannot make any difference. if all the parties get united as one anything can be done to improve the environment.
The writer disagrees with the statement than agrees. Environmental pollution, enviornmental degredations have shown a rapid increase in the past few years. The main reason to this disaster is that people have become more selfish and keep on passing the ball to other people saying that it is their responsibilty and not ours. Based on a recent research conducted by a group of Researchers in The United States of America, they have concluded that the most damages to the surrounding is caused by the activites done by humans.
in writers opinion, there are few steps that can be taken to improve the environment. The main step is, supporting 3-R system, that is reduce, reuse and recycle. If we could promote this system, environment can be uplifted, because there will be less amount of wastage. Secondly, volunteer cleaning programms in the society can be brought up together with education systems to the community about how to keep your environment clean. These are the some of the main things that can be done to uplift the environment.

Although government and large companies have a huge impact on the environment, I totally disagree with the previous argument and I believe that each individual can help improving the environment.
Our environment is our resposibility, it is not only subjected to government or large companies.
In fact, I believe that each individual has his or her own duty toward the environment. If any individual throw any kind of waste on the streat, this will have a huge impact on the environment. if someone throw a plastic bottel for example, it might take thousands of years for the plastic to resolve. Instead people should have the knowledge about where they should throw their waste and always look for a recycle baskets. People should be aware about how harmful it is to the environment if they throw their waste elsewhere.
Other possible way for individuals to help improving the environment is by using recycable materials, for example paper bags instead of plastic bags. This attitude will encourage recycling. Another example of emproving environment by individuals is driving electrical mobiles ratherthan old cars and trucks. This way the toxic emissions will be reduced and that will help our atmosphere and prevent global warming.

What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is no doubt that cities are amongst the most convienient places for accommodation but with it, comes many sophisticated issuses, threatening the residents quality of life.In my opinion,in order to solve this problem,it is essential for governments balance the country's population distribution by encouring people to move to rural areas.
What are the difficulties while living in large cities then?Firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.Moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .For instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.Secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.Furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.For example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs.
Hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.At first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.As a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more
job opportunities.In addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.In fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians.

That makes the surviving games in the cities becoming harder to settle or I wouldn't imageine to win.
Yes, the government should encourage people to move to regional towns. From where I based, our govern are already encouraging people to move out the cities for years, they clearly knew the problem are getting on the surface. They have offered special plans and supports for cities peoples who willingly to move out and go to the undeveloped cities.

What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Living in both big cities and regional towns have their own advantages and disadvantages. Although, regional towns are small and provide a simple lifestyle, I still think that large cities offer a better lifestyle and much better facilities.
It is true that regional towns have a simpler lifestyle and are not completely industrialized, which leads to a better environment and healthier people. Some people say that large cities have a few problems like traffic and high population. I, however, believe that the advantages of living in a big city, completely outweigh the disadvantages.
Firstly, Due the modernisation and globalisation of industries, various multinational companies look for employees and are usually situated in urban areas. People move from rural areas to urban towns to look for employment with higher salaries as well as international exposure. Secondly, cities have a vast network of transportation available which is more frequent and comfortable for the commuters. Many people from small towns transit through big cities for inter-state or international travels. Lastly, large towns provide better accommodation for people with better living facilities. They have huge buildings with many apartments which are very well structured. These buildings also have facilites like gym, pools, grocery shops e.t.c. so that residents don't have to travel far. Which is why, when people move from small towns, it is easier for them to rent a room according to their budget and requirements.

What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.
Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.
The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.
In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.
In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,
educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.

2,More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The problem of understainding whether there is an age that could be consider perfect to have a child is very debated. It is nowadays very common to have children over 40 years old. After explaining the reasons besides this tendency (a different life-style and conception of education and the role that women play in our society), I will argue in favour of this tendency by explaining that the disadvantages can be outweighed.
The reasons why today people have children in their later age are due to two factors. Firstly, there is a new conception of education and people when finish their studies sometimes have to wait years before finding a good paid position. On the other hand, new technologies and new medical treatments have made people around 60 looking in the same way as my grandmother was in her 40. The central cause of this tendency is surely linked with the role that women play in our society. They study and work and they have to find a good job position in the same way as their male counterparts have to do. This involve that a woman cannot take the time that she need to grow up a child when she is 25 (at that age she is usually in Academia yet). Rather, she will think about the possibility of having a child after started her career. Then, there are positive effects produced by this new tendency. Children are loved and considered by their parents as miracles. On the other hand, they can grow up in a family in which his parents have good jobs. Neither the mother or the father have to sacrifice a part of their life because they had a child too young.
My mum got me when she was over 40. Twenty-three years ago this was consider an exception. Although I confronted my-self with the possible disadvantages that could be produced by having child late, I cannot present them as real issues. People believe that a not-young parent cannot understand your needs and your thoughts. However, this is false. Indeed, If a person is open-minded, she will always is, whatever the age. The only possible disadvantage concerns the fear of losing your parents soon. While people start to think about the possible death of their parents when they are around 30 years old, I started to think about that when I was 20. But it is just fear. Therefore, I believe that there are not concrete reasons to be against this tendency. If we start to conceive the idea of having a baby as an immense gift, we will reasonably have to understand that we have to be prepared to grow up the child and to dedicate to him all the time he needs. Then, it is amazing if this is possible to have all of this when a woman is 25. But, if the family (father and mother together) wants to start their career first, they cannot be judged. There is not a perfect moment to have a child. Sometimes to wait involve do better.
In conclusion, I believe that there are not disadvantages to be outweighted. The two possible disadvantages I presented are not worst than those people having children at their young age have to deal with.",,,,,,6.0,problem understainding whether age could consider perfect child debated nowadays common children 40 years old explaining reasons besides tendency different conception education role women play society argue favour tendency explaining disadvantages outweighed reasons today people children later age due two factors firstly new conception education people finish studies sometimes wait years finding good paid position hand new technologies new medical treatments made people around 60 looking way grandmother central cause tendency surely linked role women play society study work find good job position way male counterparts involve woman take time need grow child 25 age usually academia yet rather think possibility child started career positive effects produced new tendency children loved considered parents miracles hand grow family parents good jobs neither mother father sacrifice part life child young mum got years ago consider exception although confronted possible disadvantages could produced child late present real issues people believe parent understand needs thoughts however false indeed person always whatever age possible disadvantage concerns fear losing parents soon people start think possible death parents around 30 years old started think fear therefore believe concrete reasons tendency start conceive idea baby immense gift reasonably understand prepared grow child dedicate time needs amazing possible woman family father mother together wants start career first judged perfect moment child sometimes wait involve better conclusion believe disadvantages outweighted two possible disadvantages presented worst people children young age deal

Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.
Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.
The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.
However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.
To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.",,,,,,8.5,past decades registered considerable decrease percentage people eager create family young age could different reasons going state clearly following paragraphs also explain believe advantages situation far outweigh disadvantages apparently society currently live undergone substantial changes years sometimes without us even noticing evident variations probably gradual rise number old people opposed dramatic fall number births fact owing decline economy nations subsequent reduction work opportunities people giving idea becoming parents 20s 30s many people see negative aspect society however strongly disagree opinion drawbacks lot people point discussing kind topics often age gap parents children admittedly someone decide child 40s without considering significant generation gap would separate kids result issues miscommunication could arise however disadvantages become secondary importance soon much remarkable benefits examined first older parents also means responsible mature caretakers consequently due broader life experience would arguably make better advisors kids mention older parents would stable secure jobs would also consistent savings devote children education turn could help latter better job future conclude although impossible take account drawbacks child advanced age advantages still outrun disadvantages thus children would first benefit situation

Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that today, people tend to give birth when they are older than their previous generation. This trend has several negative and positive effects on their daily life.
On the one hand, there are several disadvantages for those who want to have children in their later age. First, moms could suffer from many serious health problems when they give birth late. Those who are older than 35 of age has the higher rate of death because their hormone levels are not suitable for giving birth which lead to medical accidents. Second, boys or girls whose their mother is older than 35 also tend to suffer from many problems. For example, it is easier to have pneumonia for children from those mothers because the preterm birth rate of this group of mothers is higher.
On the other hand, I am on the side with those who believe that there are more benefits to having children when they are older. Firstly, people could prepare a better foundation for their children. Raising a boy or a girl is a job which needs both much effort, money and time. Therefore, many people decide to work hard and earn much money they can because it could build a more solid infrastructure for their children. Secondly, it is important for children to have both their parents during their process of growing up. The rate of crime in terms of teenagers, who grow up without mother or father, is higher than those who live with parents. Thus, the decisions such as having marriage or giving birth are crucial when the younger tend to decide quickly.

Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","At present, it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures. Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion.
One major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers.
These changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do.

Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.
Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.
It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.
As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.

2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the '70s of the last century started, the world lived a social revolution that led to a change in the family structure and in family roles' conception.
I believe these changes are positive and take people to be more inclusive towards all forms of love: heterosexual and homosexual. The social revolution permitted also women to impose their role in the workplace as leaders and not just in the house as mothers.
In the last decades a revolution concerning the concept of family led to conceive the couple and not just the married heterosexual couple with at least a child as complete and valued families. This social step is crucial since before that people who loved a person of the same sex as well as women who decided to have no child were treated by society as the maker of the family collapse. In Sicily, for instance, where there is still a lot of work to be done in this respect, it was almost crazy to define a group of people composed of a woman and a man with a son born outside marriage to fall under the concept of family. Therefore, I believe that this social change is taking people to believe step by step that all forms of love must be respected and most crucially they are starting to understand the concept of family as the non-physical place in which love lives.
The role of women in the workplace and in the house radically changed in the same years. The revolution concerned both the conception of women as free independent workers who obtain leadership positions as well as the conception of women as wifes and mothers. Indeed, women are no anymore required to live their life trying to make the house perfectly clean, satisfy the husband's desires and grow up the children. At the same time, husbands discover again their role as fathers and not just as money-maker of the house.

2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Recently, there have been significant changes in the family structure and family roles. This essay will illuminate some of these changes and analyse whether such changes are beneficial or detrimental.
One of the most prominent changes in this regard refers to the tendency of couples having fewer children or even no children, which may be attributed to adults' increasing workload and ensuing inability to look after children properly. Given their hectic schedules and rational concerns about their limited time and patience in taking care of adolescents, many couples would rather have fewer children. Another change is the growing trend of females joining the workforce, as necessitated by increasing living expenses, such as utility bills and property prices. To afford such costs and reach expected living standards, females have to give up being family women and apply for jobs. The other factor driving women to take jobs is the popularity of feminism upholding that women should be equal to men in all aspects, including employment.
As far as I am concerned, these changes derive from people's practical and merticulous considerations in the face of huge challenges, namely, the lack of time to take care of minors and soaring living costs. To tackles these obstacles, it is necessary for people to make such changes. Therefore, I vehemently support these changes.
To sum up, the modern society is witnessing great changes in the family structure and family roles, as exemplified by the smaller family size and larger number of females taking jobs.

It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.
Some people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.
It is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.

2,"Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.
There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.
Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.

2,"Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There are two contrasting views concerning the role of out past for our life today. According to the former there is nothing we can learn for our history. Instead, the latter sustains that the past a vital source for the understaing of our present life. I believe that in virtue of the action made in the history we must learn what is better and what is dangerous for human's life. History is then our method to evaluate whether the choices we make at the present time are right or wrong.
I believe that history can teach us more than we can imagine. The past teached us how much pain humans being tolerate because of the wars. To understand the reasons and the causes of the conflicts between the countries it is the best way to proceed through a more pacific and civil relationship among the States. To make the idea clearer I want to propose the following analogy as example: as the awarness of our past actions (in other words, the actions we have done when we were children) taught that the fire burns and that we should pay attention when we get closer to it, we then can understand how much pain a war can take with it by reflecting on the pains that aflicted our ancestors because of the Second World War.
On the other hand, there are people supporting the thesis according to which history cannot teach anything to us. They start from the idea that our life today is completely different, techonological and then very far from what our ancestors lived. The world in which we live seems to them as another world with respect to that in which their grandparents lived. Hence, history results to be as a novel that cannot be used to make easier the human's progress. Thus the errors made by our grandfathers cannot be analysed with the contemporary eyes, they maybe could not be understood totally. Then the past's mistakes are not an alarm to remind us what we did and what we should try to escape from. Rather, they are nothing, just memories. According to this way of thinking, the world seems to be divided in temporal blocks each of which has no links with the others. History is reduced to an intricate novel.
In conclusion, I believe that history should be conceived as the first evaluation step of our present actions.

2,Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Being wealthy could impact many people wether it could be positive or negative. There are certain aspect about being wealthy in which it could give oppurtunity to others and aid them through their toughest times.
According to my point of view, being wealthy could be very beneficial to others who may not achieve the same oppurtunity as the ones with all the wealth. But according to my knowledge about this argument, being rich gives other individuals the oppurtunity to help. I do believe it is crucial for a rich person to help others since it gives a positive impact to them. There could be negative influences to a rich person associated with others but for the majority, its very beneficial.
Since I have grown up in a city where poverty and the wealthy people were mixed together. Throughout my upbringing, I have been involved with peers who were financially stable yet some were not so fortunate. All throughout my childhood and adulthood I was gracefully apart of the middle class where we were financially stable and were able to end the month without a struggle. I consider myself as someone with a big heart where if one of my mates were unable to afford a specific food or snack, out of kindness and care I would propose to pay for it.
The government in the city that I have spent my life in plays a major role into financially helping the citizens who are not financially stable. The government would donate large amounts of money and gift the major population money according to their stability. The government would gift money to people who have been a part of the society wether it was having a specific job or helping clean up the city when it went through a hurricane or other crisis. As far as I am concerned, the government in my city is extremely wealthy with large amounts of money to spare for its people. Of course there are certain limits on the amount the government gifts but for the majority of the time they have little to no struggle when helping other people.",,,,,,7.0,wealthy could impact many people wether could positive negative certain aspect wealthy could give oppurtunity others aid toughest times according point view wealthy could beneficial others may achieve oppurtunity ones wealth according knowledge argument rich gives individuals oppurtunity help believe crucial rich person help others since gives positive impact could negative influences rich person associated others majority beneficial since grown city poverty wealthy people mixed together throughout upbringing involved peers financially stable yet fortunate throughout childhood adulthood gracefully apart middle class financially stable able end month without struggle consider someone big heart one mates unable afford specific food snack kindness care would propose pay government city spent life plays major role financially helping citizens financially stable government would donate large amounts money gift major population money according stability government would gift money people part society wether specific job helping clean city went hurricane crisis far concerned government city extremely wealthy large amounts money spare people course certain limits amount government gifts majority time little struggle helping people
2,"There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.",,,,,,9.0,world today often divided two categories developed less developed countries division significant terms health wealth education minimise gap argued richer countries morally responsible support less wealthy personally feel prosperous countries obligated expected contribute development countries weaker address argument history wealthy countries relevant many less developed countries former colonies therefore wealthy countries historical impact less wealthy thus richer countries economies dependent currently less developed countries rich status furthermore even today wealthy countries contribute wealth inequality exploiting inhabitants less developed countries giving workers lower wages people within countries due dependence poorer countries influence richer countries imbalance concluded richer countries indeed morally obliged help less wealthy view country charge inhabitants therefore need provide health education basic necessities addition simply providing three services would lead closing wealth gap would rather helpful invest sustainably poorer countries help create systems allowing countries conclusion moral necessity wealthy countries aid poorer ones simply providing basic necessities sufficient sustainable idea would teach countries plan provide giving economic incentives

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.",,,,,,9.0,debate whether better rent property one lives one strong supporters side persuasive arguments points main advantages renting property flexibility usually tenant give month notice changing lives property owned change needed property must put onto market frequently long stressful process get sale completed sometimes wrong time year bad market mean sale possible another advantage renting large amount family capital tied property property cost hundreds thousands dollars often lot one rents money spent things help improve family quality life property mortgage deposit also often large tied property pressure make substantial payments every month cause lot property various advantages though even though people usually service mortgage every month payments money built property renting money lost landlord end term mortgage whole property owned family makes process living property type investment addition property value often goes time frequently creating substantial profit owning property one lives also create sense decision whether one rents owns property one lives really boils individual preference opinion much preferable property mainly creates valuable asset family
2,People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women.

2,Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.",,,,,,9.0,apartment blocks common sight cities around world especially popular large cities locations building land scarce living buildings various advantages disadvantages town planners inhabitants significant advantage apartment blocks probably town planners land often premium large cities one way maximise space build upwards population density per square kilometre increased demand housing big cities therefore easily met also disadvantages town planners heavier population density put added pressure social facilities example sewage waste disposal provision adequate school medical also advantages disadvantages actual inhabitants apartment blocks demand housing reduced prices therefore high making housing affordable many people also like responsible garden living apartment advantage finally many people living area many friendships made community spirit built appears significant disadvantage practice living apartment blocks lifestyle many people want city neighbourhoods living spaces often associated poor living conditions undesirable social elements addition many people view apartment blocks unsafe example case fire tall buildings difficult impossible evacuate clear apartment blocks benefits drawbacks also clear however due need house increasing numbers people cities architectural features stay whether people like

It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output.

Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession.

2,The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.",,,,,,9.0,today society overwhelmingly depends products made fossil fuels people would initially think fuel transport course fossil fuels part fabric life around us plastics furniture pavements walk changing reliance resources various consequences however believe overall society benefit finding viable alternatives whether alternatives developed positive effect transport reduction associated pollution significant exhaust fumes motor vehicles planes ships decrease air quality contribute global warming greenhouse effect people health health planet surely improve without industries relying fossil fuels could type transport crisis could develop result society longer provide power transport many individuals want go however bad thing could force society use alternative solutions transport sharing public transport development change mind set already begun countries already committed fossil fuel free transport cities banning private vehicles centre positive development would time money would put developing renewable sources energy wind power solar power hydropower tidal power technologies would improve efficient world would use fewer sources energy cause pollution development also seen today many governments committing proportions power needs coming renewable therefore strongly agree statement changes reducing reliance fossil fuels positive caveat society need developed alternative sources power rather soon order avoid energy crisis

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried.

2,Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society.

2,"With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books.

2,It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area.

What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial.

2,Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development.

2,The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today.

2,"Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children.

2,It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.",,,,,,9.0,sad fact criminals leave prison go commit crime various reasons also things done prevent reason recidivism due lack legitimate income many people turn crime find alternative earn money person comes prison often case opportunities legitimate income fact opportunities even reduced employers often less willing give job people also return crime spend time prison sentence criminals great environment rehabilitation sometimes even network contacts made help develop criminal activities important way help address problem education criminals turned illegal activities alternatives earn living need learn way earn wage trade vocational skills computer skills example high demand someone trained could possibly find work addition governments offer incentives employers attract give jobs prisoners would help people really want return crime achieve fresh start keeping people prison expensive business governments might find cheaper pay sum people returning crime tragedy avoided possible today society education incentives directly address reasons could make society happier safer place

Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction.

This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well.

2,"In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.",,,,,,9.0,many countries around world boys girls educated together group countries however educate boys girls separately frequently done religious grounds always system produce various advantages principal reasons educating boys girls separately together distract puberty boys strongly attracted girls vice versa result disruptive conduct classroom example show one another separating boys girls therefore distinct advantage reducing disturbing behaviour however teachers pointed model always work separated boys girls equally disruptive class sometimes teachers say opposite sex classroom actually improve educators also believe boys girls different learning styles needs separating boys girls allow teachers address needs easily also belief single sex schools allow gender stereotypes challenged therefore education aspirations major disadvantage separating boys girls education children miss important formative behavioural development interaction gender regular basis lead shyness seriously dysfunctional relationships later life people also feel mixed sex schools promote gender stereotypes rather reducing conclusion feel children educated together although would respect system separated due religious beliefs personal opinion different genders learn interact together early age would allow develop healthy working relationships

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced.

When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need.

With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this.

2,"Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.",,,,,,9.0,punishing children physical force corporal punishment also called something accepted long ago people age forty may well remember nowadays however corporal punishment law countries adults practise taken court children always vulnerable group depend adults protection education course part growing process testing breaking boundaries nearly always necessary instill discipline child whether necessary use physical force emotive corporal punishment often defend standpoint explaining corporal punishment excessive argue child beaten severely bruised cut argue infliction mild pain causes effective discipline also fear might applied people grew experiencing might offer point oppose using physical force child would say vulnerability innocence child means force never used children need trust adults believe harm come additionally children learn adults argued corporal punishment teach children force answer various problems also claimed corporal punishment added benefits forms discipline require physical force using cause psychological harm children classed child believe limited use forms corporal punishment cause harm parent administers mild form child subject criminal proceedings nevertheless would use also recognise possibilities adults child parents misusing corporal punishment therefore believe balance physical force discipline children permitted
2,"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.",,,,,,9.0,travelling today simple extent within twelve hours one travel europe singapore crossing nearly whole globe based simplicity tourism changed significantly years past family would proud drive two hours lake many families think nothing travelling far side world also downside increased pollution result extra taxes flights accommodation therefore offered solution increase cost tourism reduce matter major transportation used travelling creates pollution decrease amount pollution caused tourism tourism industry would weakened increased taxes based travelling distance people would willing stay closer home country many even slight increase would mean planned holidays would expensive accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs matter distance travelled therefore increased taxes levied travel accommodation tourism therefore pollution would hand main transport methods would impacted imposing extra taxes would communal ones planes trains buses increasing taxes would also impact also holidays vital part ordinary people lives escape work stress get spend valuable time families stopping people travelling would greatly impact simple pleasures ordinary conclusion tourism impacts environment significantly simply introducing extra taxes transport accommodation drastic measure could valuable change methods transportation decrease pollution instead making people stay close home
2,Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.",,,,,,9.0,modern day society money driving force nearly everyone people aspire financially secure ability live life want however everyone able find paid employment reason countries around world governments initiated system unemployed receive regular payment enable survive people believe excellent idea whilst others believe exhausting country financial looking positive aspects system said prevents individuals private bankruptcy somebody becomes unemployed costs rent dwelling bills water telephone electricity well cost food several things without salary person fall debt unable cover expenses national unemployment payment system therefore prevent person losing nearly everything time without system many people would become homeless would potentially engage criminal activities survive therefore one say system positive although stories heard people exploiting system usually newly unemployed want find job fast order become financially independent meaning government support positive aspects system one also say payment made government high prevent people looking work actively occasionally payment people receive higher potential salaries deterring working creating cost government potential solution could providing free training employment support open new career opportunities higher income would motivate group conclusion unemployment benefits system positive negative aspects personally believe positive effects system outweigh negative payment must remain level helps people survive without regular salaries seem attractive exploit longer period time

As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators.

2,"There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.",,,,,,9.0,perform well job people motivated multiple strategies employers incentivise employees obvious one salary however job satisfaction ability help people methods improving performance majority people receiving salary end month motivation money necessary fulfill basic needs materialistic desires employees see opportunities receiving salary therefore work achieve money furthermore performing well job often lead promotions higher pay packages receive staff stand positively jobs salary therefore key motivational tool many workforce money far incentive another aspect affecting performance job satisfaction person comfortable work likely perform well therefore motivational tool interlinks salary people content perform well chances promotion increase individuals though passion drive prime examples humanitarian jobs salaries often high choosing work field often driven passion help others prioritised conclusion income might common motivational factor unusual sole incentive working hard people motivated wholly due reasons
2,"Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.","The writer presented ideas and examples that are relevant and directly related to the topic.

2,More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?,"An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.",,,,,,8.0,alarming number people today consume drinks whether form soda energy drinks fruit drinks often consumers lured widespread availability convenience however marketing campaigns also play role targeting young people giving perception sugary drinks unhealthy actually availability types drinks greatly increased time found almost store restaurant makes easily accessible almost anyone fact often cheaper alternatives water freshly squeezed juice makes especially attractive option budget marketing campaigns sugary beverages quite successful creating positive associations attached products advertisements tv billboards encourages people consider fun rather unhealthy normalises within reversing rise popularity sugary drinks still possible act attack problem different angles one first steps educating people health risks associated high sugar intake make decisions selecting type beverage consume companies also held accountable law misleading marketing campaigns aimed children teenagers likely believe false claims products health benefits without fully understanding sold schools colleges universities institutions catering young people consider banning sugary drinks replacing refreshing alternatives without added important recognise potential health risks posed consuming much sugar soft drinks take actionable steps towards reversing trend order ensure wellbeing greater education government regulation increased corporate responsibility ensure people understand reducing intake sugary beverages important still allowing access enjoyable yet healthier options
2,"Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?","It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.",,,,,,8.0,uncommon teenagers worship celebrities singers actors many young people around world look stars attempt emulate lifestyles opinion allowing children idolize celebrities often detrimental frequently set poor today celebrities tend lack moral values promote behaviour inappropriate young people instance music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use violence addition media often reports celebrities indulge excessive partying drinking alcohol despite underage types headlines negative influence impressionable teens might falsely believe follow suit appear cool morals issue many popular stars also irresponsible spending habits routinely splurge luxury items designer clothing expensive cars without consideration budgeting saving money responsibly kind behaviour dangerous normalizing materialism teaching teens costly possessions bring happiness instead focusing really matters life meaningful relationships knowledge hard conclude young adults keep mind society perception fame fortune based temporary insubstantial things rather actually matters grand scheme things would far beneficial teenagers spend time developing set values rooted quality education strong family relationships
2,Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?,"Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.",,,,,,8.0,many people strive achieve balance often find failing despite best efforts surprising balancing work life commitments extremely difficult due unique major reasons many people struggle achieve harmony personal professional lives easier ever people stay connected outside regular work hours led expectation employees always available risk seen unreliable uncommitted effect longer working hours little time left leisure activities socialising engaging hobbies sports help reduce stress levels improve overall type pressure lack free time lead feelings burnout respite life pressures resulting chronic fatigue diminished motivation struggling find suitable balance require joint efforts managers employees workers instance need recognise importance taking regular breaks throughout day getting enough sleep night employers consider flexible comes allowing staff work remotely offering paid vacation days give employees space mentally physically enabling better manage commitments without overextending conclusion achieving successful balance something many quite reach due external pressures employers lack downtime however issues overcome create realistic boundaries professional lives personal goals make conscious decisions want spend time
2,In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.",,,,,,8.0,today digital world online communication become norm many workplaces development offers numerous advantages companies greater flexibility efficiency also brings certain disadvantages like miscommunication must weighed primary advantages online communication makes easier teams stay touch without physically convene especially beneficial individuals groups dispersed across vast distances reduced travel costs well time saved travel meetings also represent meaningful savings businesses additionally online communication platforms often range features designed make collaboration efficient providing easy way share documents materials remote team members illustrate digital resources sent quickly securely via email software services like dropbox google potential drawback associated relying heavily online communication work lack physical proximity members team often lead misunderstandings due loss context nonverbal cues would otherwise present meetings however opinion issues nature solved using written language carefully avoid confusion miscommunication among conclusion online communication tools used properly undoubtedly provide companies greater flexibility teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity communication quality efficiency
2,"Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?","The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.",,,,,,8.0,benefits walking numerous experts recommend good way keep healthy fit despite number people walk daily basis decline reasons manifold also several solutions may help people walk time common reason people cite engaging form physical activity days people hectic schedules involve juggling work home responsibilities result often exhausted pressed time therefore opt faster comfortable forms transport cars bikes public transport another major reason reduced number pedestrians roads lack safety workers free walk day skip evenings early morning hours feel safe enough quite solutions issue one making walkers safe means government ensure enough sidewalks streetlights available every suburb pedestrians walk jog safely whenever time allows another useful option create special walking tracks parks neighbourhoods people get exercise evenings added benefit promoting healthy lifestyle walking community makes solution even conclude pressures daily life lack safely walking reduce popularity healthy practice governments reverse trend creating green spaces people walk addressing safety concerns
2,"In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?","Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget.

2,Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?,"Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.",,,,,,8.0,many people believe newspapers play pivotal role shaping way think numerous ways affects society believe influence mostly long source valuable information kept societies abreast latest happenings world since average citizen minimal knowledge information expert analysis articles newspapers powerfully poised form public opinion images carefully worded commentary leaves reader choice trust accuracy unbiased objectivity used core idea behind journalism seems thing past arrival spread social media platforms caused gradual decline print media subscriptions circulation since readers tend favor internet social media stay informed current affairs gave rise worrying trend newspapers using sensationalist controversial tactics improve sales result constant barrage bad news led society sees vulnerable powerless ever make matters worse plenty instances newspapers used spread false propaganda usually politically although newspapers lifeline world around us recent trend publishing misinformation mostly negative impact readers hope newspapers go back publishing impartial accounts latest news future
2,Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?,"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.",,,,,,8.0,raising price car fuel believed people excellent method solve growing number environmental issues however strongly disagree idea would make life difficult households making fuel expensive change habits wealthy families switching fossil fuel alternatives could prove much beneficial compelling reason raising cost fuel upper classes society hardly affected rising fuel costs makes minor proportion expenditure continue use personal vehicles wish without thought environment higher fuel prices even country public feel crunch decision households since travelling major part people routine work school shopping driving almost unavoidable many instances therefore raising price petrol would serve widen gap rich poor serve inadvertent form reason increasing cost fuel far best way deal environmental pollution much viable alternatives due rapid advances technology scientists engineers able develop several alternatives fossil fuel cars powered electricity naturally produced biofuel move adopt clean energy sources instead fossil fuels much promising alternative compared simply making fuel conclusion believe governments world invest time money finding alternatives fossil fuels environmentally friendly rather simply raising cost petrol
2,"Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.","The writer has addressed all parts of the task in their response.

2,"These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?","Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.","All parts of the task are sufficiently addressed in this response.

2,"Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?","International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.","The writer provided a complete response to the task prompt and offered elaborated and convincing ideas that fully meet the task’s requirements.

2,"People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.","The writer gave a thoughtful response to the task prompt, including relevant, expanded, and supported ideas that completely satisfy the requirements of the task.

2,"Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.","The writer provided a well-developed response to the topic with pertinent, expanded, and supported ideas that fully address all aspects of the task.

2,Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?,"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.","The writer’s response fully covered every aspect of the task.

2,"Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.","The writer fully addressed all parts of the task in their response.

2,Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information.

2,"In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?","In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position.

2,Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?,"In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.","The writer discussed both sides of the argument and presented relevant examples.

2,"Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.","The writer discussed both sides of the argument, expressed his/her opinion and presented relevant arguments to support it.

2,"In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?","The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.","The candidate displays a clear understanding of the task.

2,"Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.",,,,,,8.0,parents teachers many countries feeling increasingly concerned effect digital devices vital skills children alarmed declining ability young people read write suspected link influence modern technology wholeheartedly share view essay outline reasons watch consequences widespread use computers mobile phones school important period children develop fine motor skills involved learning write time spent typing mobile phone tablet contribute necessary workout small muscles hands fingers young people get less practice writing also fewer opportunities train spelling words since autocorrect autocomplete features use first letters guess entire word therefore making unnecessary child remember type correctly another companion unrestrained use mobile devices jargon often used text messages words shortened distorted exposure texting tends replace correct words abbreviations young minds causing spelling accuracy another casualty unrestricted access smart devices video content appealing immersive kids often automatically drawn instead books reading requires regular practice needs become habit order fully develop skill however perceived boring labourious activity many youngsters compared effortless easy instant access videos movies pushes books list preferences young audience takes significant commitment parents teachers ensure children continue read sum modern technology friend foe young children depending choices adults lives make regulating amount screen time purpose without due care writing reading abilities kids harmed enjoyable activities use devices
2,It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",,,,,,8.0,people subscribe belief reading helps enhance language skills creativity whereas watching television little abilities personally support opinion several reasons laid know books use text convey ideas quite often images illustrations picture scenes described book therefore use imagination reading example reading fantasy novel contains mythical creatures one would normally see appearance characters mind following plot contrast movie heroes tv screen usually created viewer directors producers film watching tv substitutes need develop one imagination characters surroundings shown argued reading best way expand one vocabulary reader learns correct spelling word seeing printed book grasp meaning context without look dictionary new words also numerous sentence structures learnt books take advantage benefits english teachers many schools use english novels teaching materials students asked read story capture keywords answer questions exam comparison learning new words watching tv show always easy viewer attention drawn action screen subtitles spelling words obvious makes book effective tool language learner compared conclusion believe people love read tend active imagination advanced linguistic comprehension watch television since readers required imagine story book learn meaning new words context
2,"Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.",,,,,,8.0,environmental problems clearly something often discussed today world one part society claims individuals change habits lifestyle improve ecological situation others hand believe issue solved governmental level essay discuss sides argument perspective hard deny human kind responsible current environmental situation seems impossible achieve noticeable result field without participation vast majority individuals instance simple lifestyle change introducing separation household rubbish make recycling projects convenient efficient moreover consumers reduce usage plastic items turn less plastic waste contaminate many people still feel government tools prevent environmental changes one option authorities discourage citizens using personal vehicles charging high taxes additional fees moreover politicians usually access resources educate people environmental problems promote important ecological projects levels ranging special courses schools tv shows websites related topic furthermore key responsibility government protect environment spending state funds research modern equipment countries legislation protects ecology example norway achieved visible results overcame environmental conclusion believe combined approach work best prevent reverse environmental changes contribution every individual important intervention government order fix existing issues save planet future generations
2,Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?,"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.",,,,,,8.0,trend emerged last two decades youngsters watching tv ever one main reasons behind issue recent advancements technology gaming film industries tendency pros cons discussed latest developments video game consoles attracted children adults spend extra time watching tv compared past interactive gaming characters high quality graphics children likely spend long hours playing games front tv recent survey showed tv addiction among young people example significantly increased 5 80 supposedly caused introduction advanced gaming consoles increase also partially due films drama series cartoons easily available pirated websites various gaming trend negative positive effects young citizens time spent watching tv adversely affects mental physical wellbeing child instance obesity ratio among young individuals past 10 years risen dramatically caused health problems anxiety depression however tv also used positive way great source information help youngsters increase knowledge succeed future conclusion recent breakthroughs technology driving amount time youngsters spending front tv screens harm good regulate use tv parents power make tv time useful beneficial children
2,"High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?","Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.",,,,,,8.0,cities create new housing growing populations constructing smaller number buildings cities create buildings solution better opinion sample essayrising population urban areas leaves governments choice build houses meet demand however comes construction one way build new homes cities prefer construct fewer residential towers others build larger number residents essay options discussed viable solution advantage tall buildings accommodate large number people small footprint type construction popular central city areas land scarce expensive example new york city buildings significantly reduced housing problems much 55 last years result strategy rents tend decrease positive impact economies cities however tall buildings offer little privacy force certain rules regulations upon residents attract higher maintenance chance voice opinion many individuals would prefer live buildings even build houses option might attractive big families older generation people like personal space accessibility also concern elderly taking stairs lifts break may option addition one houses easier cheaper maintain compared modern apartment towers downside type dwellings occupy much land since land cheaper city fringes new estates tend built away city centres increases commute time work residents negatively affects quality conclusion buildings unique advantages disadvantages opinion high rises suitable younger residents built areas young population prevalent closer city centre employment opportunities senior citizens supply lower dwellings available quieter locations flexible approach good way address needs growing city population
2,« Previous,"Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?Sample EssayNowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.",,,,,,8.0,nowadays celebrities earn money politicians reasons positive negative development sample essaynowadays celebrities make money compared people working politics essay look possible causes tendency explain opinion negative two main reasons celebrities generate income politicians one advent internet ways available celebrities earn money online streaming services example singing song youtube video advertisements enables easily make million dollars another cogent reason growing global concerns excessively high remuneration political leaders easily lead public discontent response criticism many governments decided reform reward system lawmakers sending salaries downward personally believe development relatively negative several reasons main one potential corruption scandals issue create enormous salary gap celebrities political leaders might discourage legislators putting work even motivate commit crimes money laundering addition relatively low salary stressful jobs governors may deter people foresight politics becoming politicians particularly undesirable would result low level citizens loyalty incompetent government creating unstable society crime social conclusion fact celebrities paid political leaders caused wider variety income sources available supported social norm politician profit driven professional however believe negative trend may lead political corruption less talented governments
2,"Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion)","Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow.

2,"Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion)","Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.",,,,,,8.0,people believe women treated equal men applying job police military others think women less suitable kind job discuss views give essayin recent years gender equality employment topic heated debate may argue women less suited certain jobs police military believe female candidates treated male consider women unsuited kinds jobs including police military often hold opinion jobs extremely physically demanding female body smaller muscles less physical strength compared male body women may difficulty engaging strenuous activity exhausting even men military service female soldiers likely struggle defending male peers forced move around carrying heavy firearms battle increase risk mission failure hazards extreme conditions may encounter people advocate women suitable work believe female applicants considered police military placements without gender bias women suited certain tasks police service female officers perform important roles occasions body search male officers restricted touching female convicts military service female nursing staff likely care better injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes dedicated professionals furthermore sake fairness job seekers equal opportunity choose jobs freely regardless gender many women desire work police military relevant expertise qualifications therefore discriminated employment opportunities conclusion although say women incompatible police military duties high physical demands believe treated equal men certain roles police military suitable women men therefore genders equal employment opportunities
2,"In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?","In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle.

In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.",,,,,,8.0,many countries around world young people decide leave parents home finish school start living sharing house friends positive negative development give reasons answer include relevant essaynowadays becoming increasingly common youngsters start independent life moving parents home graduation school trend positive effects society reasons behind discussed next various benefits young people parents individuals start living independently finishing school young adults way take care daily needs house chores cooking cleaning financial independence thus instead wasting time childish activities motivated learn skills work order cover living expenses although might seem challenging live first would give valuable experience helping become mature responsible adults parents would also pleased practice since enjoy lives time would financial flexibility due independence children also change habits order adapt new generation lifestyle instance allows many people travel around world would impossible children stay finishing high might challenges involved way life cases especially influence new friends housemates youngsters might choose get involved dangerous activities involve drugs petty crimes however instead keeping children close adulthood parents prepare advance raise children distinguish right wrong teach take responsibility conclusion although might adverse consequences relatively new practice believe advantages young people leaving family home outweigh drawbacks children parents
2,"In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?","In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately.

2,Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss),"Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence.

2,Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss),"Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention.

2,"When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree)","When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response.

2,Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).,"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work.

2,"Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?","Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue).

2,"Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree)","Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition.

2,"Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion)","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,people believe government take care old people provide financial support retire others say individuals save working years fund retirement opinion give reasons answer include examples true people advance golden years require help attention reason significant number people hold opinion government provide financial assistance elderly however tend agree argue workers saving portion income nest egg begin culture saving rather depending government may foster overall economic development country words people accumulate savings pension age would lessen financial burden government result government would able release funds productive purposes development infrastructure industries hospitals may expedite overall progression addition economic factors putting money aside personal benefits since people dependent state living expenses may instill sense pride hand reliant financial assistance often face negative societal stigma many people consider inferior unworthy members society hence live life dignity pride taking responsibility funding one retirement evidently better option individual contrast provision monetary outlays retirees proven unfeasible many countries since many nations number senior citizens rise long run governments likely struggle sustain cost providing elderly early signs seen many countries forced raise retirement age including home country men retire age 67 instead therefore foreseeable future kinds support may become completely conclusion provision state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen concern retirees extent however considering issue sustainability provision better opt individual savings beginning working life benefit individual national response addresses parts topic discussing merits funding one retirement versus relying government pension writer opinion stated well clear neat presentation ideas helped appropriate paragraphing cohesion coherence maintained throughout essay author vocabulary seems rich variety sentence structures used essay overall essay deserves ielts band 8
2,Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree),"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide.

2,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?","Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue.

2,"Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion","Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,many parents encourage young people leave home become older others think stay home family discuss views give tremendous influence modernisation remarkable changes taken place family structure extent nowadays youngsters motivated parents live alone grow however people view practical youngster live one hand many positive aspects youths living away parents young age provides opportunity young people live life terms make decisions without interference parents besides living alone makes independent also makes crucial life skill successful career instance managing house chores cleaning paying bills cooking make well experienced learning managing diverse activities also boost hand denying fact youngsters living away family may find circumstances may adversely affect life naïve inexperienced young people absence parental supervision likely fall prey bad influence dangerous activities drugs alcohol consumption may jeopardise career lead astray moral values however situation less likely take place youngsters still living parents besides emotional bonding family relationships maintained better everyone living together one opinion although encouraging youngsters live alone may lead learn various life skills negative aspects risks associated living alone far outweigh response covers task topic well discussing positive negative aspects living alone young adult writer opinion also included paragraphing helps present ideas orderly way cohesion coherence maintained throughout essay repetitive use word make first body paragraph could avoided apart writer vocabulary seems quite rich allows communicate ideas precisely clearly overall essay seems worthy ielts band 8
2,"What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?","Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow.

2,Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive.

2,"Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?","Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue).

2,"Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?","Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate.

2,"The education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country, agree/disagree (from Target Band ","This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt.

2,"Obesity is becoming common among children, give reasons and solutions (from Target Band ","This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question.

2,"Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ","This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content.

2,Dieting can change a person’s life for better or worse (from Target Band ,"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskDieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruin one’s health completely. What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information. The use of advanced vocabulary enables accuracy of expression and highlights flexibility.

2,Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ,"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression.

2,"IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss)","Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free.

2,Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree),"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing.

2,Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree),"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar.

2,Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree),"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes.

2,"Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions)","Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices.

2,People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree),"Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing.

2,"The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?","In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention.

2,Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree),"In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary.

2,Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree),"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay.

2,Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions),"Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words.

2,Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss),"Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding.

2,should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?,"Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes.

Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay.

2,should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?,"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally.

2,Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?,"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay.

2,"Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?","Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay.

2,"Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?","Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay.

2,"Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?","In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay.

2,Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?,"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections).

2,Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.","This essay is too long (350 words instead of 250).

2,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and .

2,"In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?","Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.","This is a great essay, a Band 7+ candidate.

Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real.

I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment.

2,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?,". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.","Some of your sentences are too short – they would look better if joined together.

2,Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question.

2,Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?,"I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings.

Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side.

Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions.

2,"The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research.

2,Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.,", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.","This is a very good essay, you have made your arguments well and set out the paragraphs as required.

For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events.

In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree.

2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?,"With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method.

In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive.

Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life.

Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers.

There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work.

2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?,"Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness.
