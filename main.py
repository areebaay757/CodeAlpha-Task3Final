# Example essay for scoring
example_essay = ["In today's world, technology plays a vital role in almost every aspect of our lives, and education is no exception. With the advancement of the internet, online learning platforms have become widely available, allowing students to access a wealth of information at their fingertips. One of the major benefits of technology in education is that it provides opportunities for personalized learning. Students can learn at their own pace, review materials, and even ask questions through various online forums. This flexibility has proven to be especially beneficial for students who may not be able to attend traditional classrooms due to geographical, financial, or personal constraints. However, while technology has revolutionized education, it also brings some challenges. A major concern is the over-reliance on digital devices, which can lead to distractions and decreased face-to-face interactions between students and teachers. Furthermore, not all students have access to the same level of technology, which can create an educational divide, especially in underdeveloped regions. Despite these drawbacks, technology is undoubtedly a powerful tool that can enhance the learning experience. It is up to educators and policymakers to ensure that the use of technology is balanced and that its benefits are maximized while minimizing its potential disadvantages."]
